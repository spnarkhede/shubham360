# Shubham Narkhede Portfolio - Project Status Report

## Project Overview
This is a Docusaurus-based portfolio website for Shubham Narkhede, featuring a comprehensive personal and professional showcase including resume, projects, experience, books, articles, and blog content.

## Cleanup and Optimization Completed

### ✅ Redundant Files Removed:
- `src/components/ArtGallery/index-glider.js` - Duplicate ArtGallery component
- `src/components/ArtGallery/ArtGallery.module.css` - Unused CSS module

### ✅ Configuration Issues Fixed:
- **Merge conflicts resolved** in `docusaurus.config.ts`
- **Import statements cleaned** using existing optimization scripts
- **Unused Lucide icons removed** from 5 files

### ✅ Build Optimization:
- **Lucide React icons optimized** using existing cleanup scripts
- **Dependencies cleaned** and unused imports removed
- **Project structure streamlined**

## Current Build Status

### Build Performance:
- The project builds successfully but with performance challenges due to the extensive use of Lucide React icons
- Build process loads all Lucide icons (~9,000+ icons) even though only ~60 are actually used
- This results in longer build times but does not prevent successful compilation

### Build Output:
- Build directory is created with proper structure
- Static assets are generated correctly
- All configuration files are properly formatted
