# First Steps at Amazon: Reflections on My First Month

It's been just over a month since I joined Amazon as an Associate Software Developer, and what a whirlwind it has been! I wanted to take some time to reflect on my experiences so far, the challenges I've faced, and the valuable lessons I've learned in this short but intense period.

## The Onboarding Experience

Amazon's onboarding process is comprehensive and well-structured, designed to immerse new employees in the company's culture, principles, and technical ecosystem. From day one, I was introduced to Amazon's famous leadership principles—14 guiding values that shape decision-making across the organization. These principles aren't just wall decorations; they're actively referenced in daily discussions and decision-making processes.

The technical onboarding was equally thorough. I spent my first two weeks navigating through Amazon's vast internal systems, setting up development environments, and completing training modules. The learning curve was steep, but the support from my team and dedicated onboarding buddies made the process manageable.

## Amazon's Culture

One of the most striking aspects of working at Amazon is the culture of ownership. Everyone is expected to take responsibility for their work and drive results. The phrase "Day 1" is often mentioned—a reminder to maintain the agility, customer obsession, and innovation of a startup, despite being one of the world's largest companies.

Meetings begin with silent reading of documents (called "narratives") rather than PowerPoint presentations. This approach ensures everyone is on the same page before discussions begin and promotes deeper thinking about complex issues. It was initially jarring but has proven to be an effective way to communicate ideas and make decisions.

## Technical Challenges

As a new developer, I've been gradually ramping up on Amazon's technical stack. The scale of the systems here is unlike anything I've worked with before. Even seemingly simple operations need to be designed with massive scale in mind.

I've been assigned to work on internal tools that facilitate business operations. My first project involves enhancing a feature that helps streamline inventory management processes. While the scope is manageable for a newcomer, it touches multiple systems and requires coordination with several teams.

The codebase is primarily Java and Spring Boot, with some Kotlin being introduced for new features. I'm also getting exposure to AWS services like Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3—technologies I had theoretical knowledge of but am now using in production environments.

## Lessons Learned

In just one month, I've gained several valuable insights:

1. **Documentation is crucial** - In complex systems, thorough documentation is not a luxury but a necessity. I've learned to appreciate well-documented code and to maintain that standard in my own work.

2. **Ask questions early** - The complexity of Amazon's systems means that getting stuck without asking for help can waste precious time. I've found that asking targeted, well-researched questions early saves hours of potential frustration.

3. **Think big but start small** - While Amazon encourages thinking at scale, practical implementation often begins with small, incremental changes that can be tested and validated before expanding.

4. **Data-driven decisions** - Every proposal or solution needs to be backed by data. Anecdotal evidence or gut feelings aren't sufficient for making decisions that could impact millions of customers.

## Looking Ahead

As I continue my journey at Amazon, I'm setting several goals for myself:

- Deepen my understanding of distributed systems architecture
- Contribute meaningfully to my team's projects
- Improve my ability to write efficient, scalable code
- Build relationships across teams to better understand Amazon's ecosystem

The learning curve remains steep, but I'm embracing the challenge. Amazon's environment pushes you to grow rapidly, and I can already see how this experience is accelerating my development as a software engineer.

I plan to share more specific technical learnings in future posts as I gain deeper expertise in particular areas. For now, I'm focused on absorbing as much knowledge as possible and contributing wherever I can.

Here's to the exciting journey ahead at Amazon!
