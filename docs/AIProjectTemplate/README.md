*You ship faster with AI. You understand less. That gap has a name — and this kit fixes it.*

## What Is Cognitive Debt?

Every time you accept AI-generated code without fully understanding it, you take on **cognitive debt** — the growing gap between what your codebase does and what your team actually comprehends about it.

Unlike technical debt (code you know is bad), cognitive debt is **code you don't even know is bad** — because you never fully understood it in the first place.

The numbers are real:
- **19% slower** — METR study, experienced devs using AI tools vs. not (2025)
- **+23.5% more incidents per PR** — Cortex 2026 Engineering Benchmark
- **Trust in AI output dropped to 33%** — Stack Overflow 2025, even as usage hit 76%
- **Code churn nearly doubled** (3.1% → 5.7%) — GitClear analysis

This kit gives your team everything needed to use AI tools actively — without losing comprehension of your own systems.

## The Core Concept: Active vs. Passive

| Pattern | Workflow | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Active ✅** | Prompt → Read → Understand → Modify → Ship | Comprehension maintained |
| **Passive ❌** | Prompt → Accept → Ship → Forget | Cognitive debt accumulates |

**The difference between these two patterns determines whether AI coding tools are a productivity multiplier or a cognitive debt factory.**

---

## Quick Start

### For a single developer (5 min)

```bash
# Clone or fork this repo, then copy what you need:
cp templates/MEMORY.md /your-project/MEMORY.md
cp templates/COGNITIVE_DEBT_CHECKLIST.md /your-project/templates/COGNITIVE_DEBT_CHECKLIST.md
cp .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md /your-project/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

Open `templates/MEMORY.md` and fill in your architecture decisions. The act of writing it is itself the first cognitive debt prevention exercise.

### For an engineering team (30 min)

1. **Fork this repo** and customize for your codebase
2. **Fill in `templates/MEMORY.md` as a team** — architecture decisions, security constraints, naming conventions, AI-Free Zones
3. **Deploy the PR template** — GitHub picks up `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` automatically
4. **Share the guidelines** — `AI_USAGE_GUIDELINES.md` is your team policy; `CODE_REVIEW_GUARDRAILS.md` is your reviewer standard
5. **Onboard everyone** via `procedures/AI_TOOL_ONBOARDING.md` before their first AI-assisted PR
6. **Schedule a comprehension review** for next sprint — block 90 minutes, assign pairs, focus on your AI-heaviest recent PRs

### For an engineering lead (45 min)

Complete the team steps above, then:
- Define your **AI-Free Zones** in `templates/MEMORY.md` (auth, payments, migrations, data deletion)
- Add the `ai-assisted` label to your PR tracker
- Set a calendar reminder for the **quarterly cognitive debt audit** (see `templates/TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md`)
- Brief your team with the 15-min standup format in `templates/TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md`

## The Five Prevention Patterns

This kit operationalizes five patterns I've refined through real AI-assisted projects:

| # | Pattern | Kit File |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | Maintain a `templates/MEMORY.md` — living architecture context for you and your AI | `templates/MEMORY.md` |
| 2 | Explain Before Merge — comprehension gate in every PR | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` |
| 3 | Comprehension Checkpoints — three questions before you accept AI output | `templates/COGNITIVE_DEBT_CHECKLIST.md` |
| 4 | Pair with Agents, Don't Delegate — you steer, AI fills | `guidelines/AI_USAGE_GUIDELINES.md` |
| 5 | Shrink the Blast Radius — &lt;200 lines, 1 concern, 100% coverage on AI paths | `guidelines/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` |

## Document Map

How the ten files connect across your team's workflow:

```
NEW ENGINEER JOINS
    └──► AI_TOOL_ONBOARDING ──► MEMORY.md + AI_USAGE_GUIDELINES

DAILY DEVELOPMENT  
    ├──► COGNITIVE_DEBT_CHECKLIST   (before accepting AI output)
    ├──► MEMORY.md                  (open in editor at all times)
    └──► PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE      (before every PR)

CODE REVIEW
    └──► CODE_REVIEW_GUARDRAILS ──► DEFINITION_OF_DONE

SOMETHING GOES WRONG
    ├──► ESCALATION_PROCEDURE       (concern identified early)
    └──► INCIDENT_RESPONSE          (production incident)

SPRINT & QUARTERLY RITUALS
    └──► TEAM_PLAYBOOK ──► MEMORY.md (audit output)
```

## AI-Free Zones

Some code paths are too consequential for cognitive debt. This kit includes a framework for declaring them and enforcing them in your review process. The default list to start from:

- Authentication & authorization
- Payment processing
- Data deletion (compliance risk)
- Database migrations (irreversible)

> AI may draft. A human must own, understand, and rewrite.
