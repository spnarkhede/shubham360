## What This Is

A curated library of instruction sets for [Microsoft 365 Copilot declarative agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-declarative-agent). Each agent is a paste-ready instruction block, ready to deploy without configuration files, coding, or Azure resources.

Every agent in this library:
- Requires a Microsoft 365 Copilot licence (the paid add-on — not included in standard M365 plans)
- Defaults to formal professional English (British spelling)
- Supports French output — write in French or ask for French output explicitly
- Includes a banned vocabulary list to prevent AI-sounding language
- Includes a built-in quality self-check the agent runs before every response
- Stays within the 8,000-character Copilot Studio instruction limit

---

## How to Deploy Any Agent

1. Go to [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/agent/new](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/agent/new) — no separate tool needed, it's built into Microsoft 365 Copilot.
2. Enter the **Name** and **Description** from the agent file's frontmatter.
3. In the **Instructions** field, paste the full block from the `## Instructions` section of the relevant file.
4. Add knowledge sources (SharePoint sites) where noted.
5. Click **Create** — the agent is immediately available to `@mention` in Copilot Chat.

> You can also create agents via [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) for advanced configuration (additional knowledge sources, actions, authentication). For instruction-only agents in this library, the built-in Agent Builder is sufficient.
