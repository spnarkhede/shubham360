# Chapter 12: Colors

## 🌈 Introduction

Colors are an essential part of everyday language. In German, colors (*Farben*) are used as adjectives and follow the same rules of declension when placed before a noun. They can also function as nouns themselves when capitalized (e.g., *das Blau* = the color blue).

## 🧱 Color Usage in Grammar

### 1. **Attributive Use (with noun)**

Colors behave like adjectives. They decline when used attributively:

* *ein **roter** Apfel* – a red apple
* *eine **grüne** Wiese* – a green meadow

### 2. **Predicative Use (after verb)**

When used with a verb like *sein*, the adjective is not declined:

* *Der Apfel ist **rot*** – The apple is red

### 3. **As Nouns**

Colors can be used as nouns to refer to the color itself:

* *Ich mag **das Blau** dieses Bildes.* – I like the blue of this picture.

Note: When used as nouns, colors are **neuter** and always capitalized.
