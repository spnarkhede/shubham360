# Chapter 37: Compound Words

German is famous for its **compound words** — where two or more words are joined together to form one longer word with a new meaning. Learning how to understand and break down these words is essential for reading and speaking German effectively.

## 📍 What Are Compound Words (Komposita)?

Compound words in German are called **Komposita**. They are formed by **joining two or more nouns** together to create a **new word** with a specific meaning.

### 🔧 Structure:

> **Word 1** + **Word 2** = **New Word**

The **last word** in the compound determines:

* **Gender** (der/die/das)
* **Plural form**
* **Main meaning**
