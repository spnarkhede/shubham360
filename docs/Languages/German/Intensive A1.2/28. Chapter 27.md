# Chapter 27: Interrogative Words (Fragewörter)

## Introduction

Interrogative words, or question words, are essential tools for asking questions in any language. In German, **interrogative words** enable you to gather information, clarify doubts, and engage in conversations. They are the foundation of forming **direct questions** and are used to inquire about people, things, time, reasons, places, manner, and quantities.

Understanding interrogatives is critical because asking questions is a fundamental part of communication. Mastering question words allows you to participate actively in conversations, interviews, surveys, and everyday interactions.

## Theory & Grammar

### Question Word Placement

* Interrogative words usually come at the **beginning** of a question sentence.
* After the question word, the **verb comes directly** (inversion), followed by the subject and other sentence parts.

Example:

* **Was machst du?** (What are you doing?)
* **Wo wohnst du?** (Where do you live?)

### Question Types Using Interrogatives

* **Open questions**: Use interrogative words to ask for specific information.
* **Yes/No questions**: Start with the verb, no interrogative word needed.
* **Indirect questions**: Interrogatives appear within statements or questions indirectly.

### Declension of Interrogatives

* Some interrogative pronouns like **welcher** decline according to gender, number, and case, similar to adjectives.

Examples:

* Welcher Mann? (Which man?) — masculine nominative
* Welche Frau? (Which woman?) — feminine nominative
* Welches Kind? (Which child?) — neuter nominative
