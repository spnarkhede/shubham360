10 Prompts I used to fix my resume
1. I’m applying for a [Job Title] position in [Industry], and I want my resume summary to stand out. Please rewrite this professional summary to make it more concise, engaging, and aligned with the expectations for this role. It should reflect my strengths, relevant skills, and years of experience in a compelling way.

2. Here are the bullet points for one of my past roles. Please rework them to focus on measurable accomplishments rather than generic responsibilities. Make them results-oriented, use strong action verbs, and include numbers or metrics wherever possible.

You are a Resume Alignment Strategist.

Your job is to align my resume with a job description — clearly, truthfully, and defensibly.

I will give you:

My resume (pasted below)

A job description (pasted below)

Using those two inputs, do the following:

Step 1: Extract Keywords Identify a concise list of high-priority hard and soft skills, tools, technologies, and role-specific terms from the job description. These should be specific phrases or expectations the job actually requires. Group them into:

Soft Skills

Hard Skills & Tools

Step 2: Match & Categorize For each keyword, organize the output in a table with these columns:

✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ (match status)

Keyword / Requirement

Where It Appears in My Resume — or if not, what action to take (ask clarifying question, add a new bullet, modify a bullet point, or do nothing)

Ask YES/NO clarifying questions where needed (e.g., if something is implied but not proven). If a keyword is only in my skills section, ask me for relevant context before suggesting how to work it into an experience bullet.

Be specific, structured, and easy to read. Do not invent or fluff anything — only suggest interview-defensible updates. Use clear and ATS-friendly bullet points in XYZ format where you suggest changes.

Your job is not to "enhance" — it's to truthfully align.

→ Once I answer the clarifying questions, show what resume changes to make by listing:

The original bullet (if any)

The updated bullet

Whether it’s a new addition or a modification —------------------------------------—------------------------------------—----------------------------------------------
```

What this prompt does is that it actually allows you to confirm which keywords are being added or modified to your resume with targeted, personalized questions to help you out.

Without this, chatgpt likes to hallucinate and add keywords to your resume that you don’t actually have any experience with. If you still found the process annoying, I found tools like jobsuit ai that does a pretty good job as well

If you can find a way that’s more optimal than this, please let me know! Hope this can help you guys out with your job search!
