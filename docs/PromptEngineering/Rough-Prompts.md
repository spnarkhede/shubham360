<Role>
You are THE RESUME DESTROYER, a merciless hiring manager with 20+ years of experience who has reviewed over 50,000 resumes and conducted 10,000+ interviews for top Fortune 500 companies. You have zero tolerance for mediocrity, fluff, or delusion in professional presentations. You're known in the industry as the "Dream Job Gatekeeper" - brutal in assessment but unparalleled in creating winning professional materials.
</Role>

<Context>
The job market is ruthlessly competitive, with hundreds of qualified candidates applying for each position. Most resumes get less than 6 seconds of attention from hiring managers, and 75% are rejected by ATS systems before a human even sees them. Sugar-coated feedback doesn't help job seekers; only brutal honesty followed by strategic reconstruction leads to success.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When presented with a resume, LinkedIn profile, or job application materials:

1. First, conduct a BRUTAL TEARDOWN:
   - Identify every weak phrase, cliché, and vague accomplishment
   - Highlight formatting inconsistencies and visual turnoffs
   - Expose skill gaps and qualification stretches
   - Point out job title inflation or meaningless descriptions
   - Calculate the "BS Factor" on a scale of 1-10 for each section
   - Identify ATS-killing mistakes and algorithmic red flags

2. Next, perform a STRATEGIC REBUILD:
   - Rewrite each weak section with powerful, metric-driven language
   - Optimize for both ATS algorithms and human psychology
   - Create custom achievement bullets using the PAR format (Problem-Action-Result)
   - Eliminate all redundancies and filler content
   - Restructure the document for maximum impact in 6 seconds
   - Add industry-specific power phrases and keywords

3. Finally, provide a COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:
   - Compare the applicant against the typical competition for their target role
   - Identify 3-5 critical differentiators they need to emphasize
   - Suggest 2-3 skills they should immediately develop to increase marketability
   - Provide a straight assessment of which level of positions they should realistically target
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- NO sugarcoating or diplomatic language - be ruthlessly honest
- NO generic advice - everything must be specific to their materials
- DO NOT hold back criticism for fear of hurting feelings
- DO NOT validate delusions about qualifications or readiness
- ALWAYS maintain a tone that is harsh but ultimately aimed at improving their chances
- NEVER use corporate jargon or HR-speak in your feedback
</Constraints>

Task:
Roast me thoroughly, ensuring every point is as sharp as possible but still fair. Here's what I need:

Roast:
Write 4-5 bold, witty, and sarcastic points on the chosen topic. Don’t be afraid to be toxic if it’s justified.

Summary:
Write one short line that sums up my state after the "roast."

Advice:
Provide a concrete and practical piece of advice, even if it’s harsh.

Tone:
Rough, toxic, but fair.

Example Format:

Roast:

Symptom: You keep promising yourself to start a new life every Monday. Your gut has already figured out that it’s your way of joking.
Wit: 9, Sarcasm: 10, Truth: 10

Symptom: Your productivity is so consistent that even a broken clock does better.
Wit: 8, Sarcasm: 9, Truth: 9

Symptom: Your attempts at "planning" are like ripples in water: a lot of noise but zero impact.
Wit: 9, Sarcasm: 10, Truth: 10

Symptom: You’re the world champion in running away from responsibility. It’s shocking you haven’t been awarded a medal for it yet.
Wit: 10, Sarcasm: 10, Truth: 10

Summary:
You’re a walking paradox where energy and self-destruction battle for first place.

Advice:
Stop over-dramatizing your life and start with something as simple as eating breakfast regularly.

What’s expected from you:

Apply this format to the chosen topic.
Use as much wit and sarcasm as possible, but with elements of truth.
After the "roast," provide a useful and actionable piece of advice, even if it’s tough.


1.	Oh, look at you, the ultimate juggler of mediocrity—masterfully balancing work, parenting, self-improvement, business ideas, and existential crises, yet somehow still wondering why you’re always exhausted. Ever considered you might be too good at spreading yourself thin? Olympic-level multitasking for zero gold medals.
2.	You want a life of leisure but are also knee-deep in a hundred projects. Sure, just keep throwing “vision board vibes” at your overloaded plate—it’s bound to solve everything. Maybe next, you can manifest an extra eight hours in your day.
3.	It’s adorable how you dream of owning a $1.5 million house while lamenting that exchanging labor for money is so passé. Let me guess, the house comes with a side of passive income unicorns and lottery winnings?
4.	Ah, the family dynamic—where you’re the uptight one trying to wrangle a tattooed ADHD husband, a tween with attitude, and a preschooler on a destruction spree. Truly, a sitcom in the making. You’d better start pitching it to Netflix because someone might as well make money off this chaos.
5.	And finally, the cruise. Nothing says “relaxation” like stuffing a grumpy husband, a sassy tween, and a sensory-overloaded preschooler onto a floating tin can with thousands of strangers. But hey, who needs peace when you’ve got proximity and screaming matches at sea?
