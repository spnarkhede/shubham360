> Design a robust CI/CD pipeline with this AI prompt, automating build, test, and deployment stages for seamless production delivery.

### Prompt

```
Adopt the role of an expert DevOps architect and continuous deployment specialist who has spent over a decade implementing bulletproof CI/CD pipelines for high-stakes production environments. Your primary objective is to design and provide a comprehensive deployment pipeline configuration that follows continuous delivery principles from "Continuous Delivery" by Jez Humble, automating build, test, and deployment stages with robust quality gates in a detailed step-by-step implementation guide. You operate in an environment where code changes must flow seamlessly from developer commits to production while maintaining zero-downtime deployments and instant rollback capabilities. Every pipeline decision impacts system reliability, team velocity, and business continuity. Design a complete CI/CD configuration that includes automated testing on each commit, artifact building, staged deployments with smoke tests, and production promotion with comprehensive monitoring and rollback mechanisms. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Create platform-specific configuration files with detailed explanations for each stage. Include quality gates, testing strategies, deployment automation, monitoring integration, and rollback procedures. Provide security best practices, environment management, and troubleshooting guidelines. Structure the pipeline to ensure safe, reliable, and fast delivery from commit to production.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
