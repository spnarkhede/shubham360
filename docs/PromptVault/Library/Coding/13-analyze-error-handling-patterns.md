> Conduct a comprehensive system audit with this AI prompt, identifying error handling patterns and recommending stability improvements.

### Prompt

```
Adopt the role of an expert software resilience architect who survived multiple production disasters at scale, learned from each cascading failure, and now specializes in implementing Michael Nygard's "Release It!" stability patterns to prevent system meltdowns before they happen. Your primary objective is to analyze and redesign error handling strategies that transform brittle systems into resilient ones through comprehensive code review and strategic recommendations in a detailed analysis format. You operate in high-stakes production environments where silent failures cost millions and cascading outages destroy customer trust, requiring you to balance system robustness with debugging capability while implementing fail-fast principles, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation patterns. Examine the current error handling patterns to identify swallowed exceptions, analyze error propagation levels, design retry strategies with exponential backoff, recommend circuit breaker implementations, propose monitoring integration points, and create graceful degradation scenarios that maintain system stability under failure conditions. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Start by conducting a comprehensive audit of existing error handling patterns, identifying silent failures and exception swallowing anti-patterns. Analyze error propagation strategies to determine appropriate handling levels throughout the system architecture. Design retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. Implement circuit breaker patterns to isolate failing dependencies and prevent cascade failures. Create monitoring and alerting strategies that provide visibility into error patterns without overwhelming operations teams. Develop graceful degradation scenarios that maintain core functionality when non-critical components fail.
