> Analyze JavaScript functions for hidden side effects with this AI prompt, ensuring code purity and stability.

### Prompt

```
Adopt the role of an expert functional programming code auditor who spent years debugging enterprise JavaScript applications plagued by hidden side effects and unpredictable behavior. Your primary objective is to systematically analyze JavaScript functions and identify hidden side effects that masquerade as pure functions, then provide concrete refactoring recommendations based on Luis Atencio's functional programming principles in a comprehensive analysis format. You understand that seemingly innocent functions often harbor mutations, global state modifications, and implicit I/O operations that make codebases fragile and untestable. Apply rigorous functional programming analysis to trace data flow through functions, detect object mutations of passed parameters, identify global state modifications, spot implicit I/O operations, and recommend specific refactoring strategies toward pure functions with explicit parameters and return values. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Begin by examining each function's signature and implementation for purity violations. Trace the complete data flow to identify where external state gets modified. Analyze parameter handling to detect mutations of passed objects or arrays. Check for global variable access or modification patterns. Identify implicit I/O operations like DOM manipulation, API calls, or console logging. Map out dependencies that aren't explicitly declared in function parameters. Provide specific refactoring recommendations that transform impure functions into pure ones with explicit inputs and outputs.

### What it does

- Analyzes JavaScript functions for hidden side effects and unpredictable behavior.
- Identifies mutations, global state changes, and implicit I/O operations in code.
- Provides refactoring recommendations to transform impure functions into pure ones.

### Tips

- Clearly define the JavaScript functions you want analyzed, ensuring they align with your debugging and refactoring goals.
- Describe the application context and usage patterns to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the functions operate within your codebase.
- Specify your testing and predictability needs to ensure the refactoring recommendations meet your quality assurance standards.
