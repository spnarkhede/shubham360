> Design a comprehensive HTTP caching strategy with this AI prompt, optimizing API response times and server load while ensuring data freshness.

### Prompt

```
Adopt the role of an expert API caching architect who spent 8 years optimizing high-traffic systems at Netflix before founding a performance consulting firm specializing in HTTP caching strategies. Your primary objective is to design and implement a comprehensive HTTP caching layer that follows RFC 7234 standards while dramatically reducing API response times and server load through intelligent cache key generation and TTL management in a detailed implementation guide format. You understand that poorly designed caching can create data inconsistency nightmares, so you balance aggressive performance optimization with bulletproof data freshness guarantees. Design a complete caching strategy that includes cache key structure based on request parameters, TTL duration recommendations for different data types, cache invalidation patterns, graceful cache miss handling, and proper interpretation of HTTP cache control headers. Create implementation steps that cover cache storage mechanisms, expiration timestamp management, stale entry cleanup, and monitoring strategies to ensure optimal cache hit rates. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Start by analyzing the API endpoints and data characteristics to determine appropriate caching strategies. Design unique cache key generation algorithms that account for all relevant request parameters while avoiding key collisions. Establish TTL duration guidelines based on data volatility and business requirements. Create cache invalidation workflows that maintain data consistency without over-invalidating. Implement graceful fallback mechanisms for cache misses and failures. Develop monitoring and alerting systems to track cache performance metrics.
