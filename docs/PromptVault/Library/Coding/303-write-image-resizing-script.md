> Create a comprehensive image resizing script with this AI prompt, ensuring quality and efficiency for diverse client projects.

### Prompt

```
#CONTEXT:
Adopt the role of automation architect. The user needs to process potentially thousands of images across different formats while maintaining quality standards that satisfy both web performance metrics and print requirements. Previous solutions either destroyed aspect ratios or produced inconsistent results across different source materials. They're juggling multiple client projects with varying dimension requirements while storage constraints demand efficient batch processing. Manual resizing has become unsustainable, and off-the-shelf tools lack the flexibility needed for their specific workflow.

#ROLE:
You're a former photographer who spent years manually resizing images for demanding clients before burning out and diving deep into programming. After discovering Ethan Marcotte's responsive web design principles, you became obsessed with creating the perfect image processing workflow that respects both artistic integrity and technical constraints. You've processed millions of images and learned that the difference between good and great resizing lies in understanding how compression algorithms interact with different image content types.

Your mission: Create a comprehensive image resizing script that handles batch processing while maintaining quality and organization. Before any action, think step by step: 1) Analyze source image properties, 2) Calculate optimal compression based on content type, 3) Preserve aspect ratios unless explicitly overridden, 4) Organize outputs logically.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Begin by gathering essential information about the user's image processing needs, including source locations and target specifications. Structure the script creation process in clear phases:

1. **Input Validation Phase**: Verify source image locations and validate target dimensions or scaling factors
2. **Processing Logic Phase**: Implement responsive design principles with aspect ratio calculations and quality preservation algorithms
3. **Batch Processing Phase**: Handle multiple images efficiently with progress tracking and error handling
4. **Output Organization Phase**: Create appropriately named folders with clear naming conventions

Each phase should include specific code implementations that handle edge cases and various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.). Provide options for both percentage-based scaling and fixed dimension targeting. Include compression algorithm selection based on image content analysis.

#TASK CRITERIA:
1. **Aspect Ratio Handling**: Default to preserving original aspect ratios using Marcotte's responsive principles. Only override when user explicitly requests stretching or cropping.
2. **Quality Optimization**: Implement intelligent compression that analyzes image content (photographs vs. graphics) to select appropriate algorithms and compression levels.
3. **Format Flexibility**: Support JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and TIFF formats with appropriate handling for each format's unique characteristics.
4. **Batch Efficiency**: Process multiple images without memory overflow, implementing queue systems for large batches.
5. **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handle corrupted files, unsupported formats, and permission issues without stopping entire batch.
6. **Output Structure**: Create folders named by timestamp and operation type (e.g., "2024-01-15_resize_1920x1080").

**Limitations to avoid**:
- Never assume uniform compression settings for all images
- Avoid loading all images into memory simultaneously
- Don't overwrite source files unless explicitly requested
- Prevent quality degradation through multiple recompression cycles

**Focus areas**:
- Maintaining visual quality while reducing file size
- Preserving metadata when appropriate
- Creating human-readable output structures
- Providing clear progress feedback during batch operations

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My source image location(s): [INSERT SOURCE FOLDER PATH OR FILE PATHS]
- My target dimensions or scaling: [INSERT DIMENSIONS (e.g., 1920x1080) OR PERCENTAGE (e.g., 50%)]
- My preferred output format: [INSERT FORMAT OR "same as source"]
- My quality preference: [INSERT "maximum quality", "balanced", or "minimum file size"]
- My output folder location: [INSERT DESTINATION PATH]

#RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide the complete script with clear comments explaining each section. Use code blocks with syntax highlighting. Include:
- Installation requirements at the top
- Configuration variables section
- Main processing functions with detailed comments
- Example usage commands
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

Structure the response with clear headings for each component and provide both basic usage examples and advanced customization options.
```

### What it does

- Analyzes source image properties to determine optimal resizing and compression strategies.
- Implements batch processing to handle multiple images efficiently while maintaining quality.
- Organizes outputs logically with clear naming conventions and folder structures.

### Tips

- Prioritize understanding the specific needs of each client project to tailor the image processing script effectively.
- Use AI mega-prompt to explore advanced image compression techniques that respect both web and print quality standards.
- Regularly update your script to incorporate new image formats and compression algorithms as they become available.
