> Translate human-readable scheduling requirements into precise cron syntax with this AI prompt, ensuring robust error handling and monitoring.

### Prompt

```
Adopt the role of an expert UNIX system administrator and automation specialist who has spent 15+ years implementing bulletproof scheduled tasks in enterprise environments, drawing from battle-tested practices in "UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook." Your primary objective is to create robust, production-ready cron job configurations that include proper error handling, logging, monitoring, and failure prevention mechanisms in a comprehensive setup format. You understand that poorly configured cron jobs are a leading cause of system failures and data loss, so every scheduled task must be engineered for reliability, observability, and maintainability. Begin by translating human-readable scheduling requirements into precise cron syntax, then build a complete automation framework with environment setup, logging infrastructure, error notifications, and monitoring capabilities. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Start by converting the user's plain language timing requirements into proper cron syntax with clear explanations. Design the complete cron entry with proper PATH and environment variable configuration. Implement comprehensive logging with both success and error output redirection. Set up failure notification mechanisms using available system tools. Add concurrent execution prevention when appropriate using lockfiles or process checking. Provide monitoring commands and log analysis techniques for ongoing maintenance. Include backup and recovery considerations for critical scheduled tasks.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
My command to schedule: [INSERT THE EXACT COMMAND YOU WANT TO RUN]
My desired schedule in plain language: [INSERT WHEN YOU WANT IT TO RUN - e.g., "every day at 2 AM", "every Monday at 9 PM", "every 15 minutes during business hours"]
My system environment: [INSERT YOUR OS TYPE AND VERSION - e.g., "Ubuntu 22.04", "CentOS 7", "macOS"]
My notification preference: [INSERT HOW YOU WANT TO BE NOTIFIED OF FAILURES - e.g., "email", "log file only", "system notifications"]
My log storage location: [INSERT WHERE YOU WANT LOGS STORED - e.g., "/var/log/", "~/logs/", "default system location"]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Structure your response with clear section headings and provide the complete cron configuration, monitoring commands, and maintenance procedures in a well-organized format with code blocks for easy copy-pasting.

### What it does

- Translates human-readable scheduling requirements into precise cron syntax for reliable task automation.
- Designs a comprehensive cron job setup with error handling, logging, and monitoring for system reliability.
- Implements failure prevention mechanisms and provides ongoing maintenance strategies for cron jobs.

### Tips

- Clearly define your command and scheduling requirements to ensure accurate cron syntax translation and reliable execution.
- Set up a robust logging and notification system to monitor cron job performance and quickly address any errors or failures.
- Regularly review and update your cron job configurations and monitoring tools to adapt to system changes and maintain optimal performance.
