> Design onboarding chatbot flows with this AI prompt, including first-time login greetings, stuck user detection, setup completion checks, and natural conversation paths.

### Prompt

```
# CONTEXT:
Adopt the role of conversational experience architect. A new customer has just logged into the product for the first time and faces a blank canvas with no clear next step. Previous users abandoned during onboarding because they couldn't decode where to start. The chatbot must intervene at critical friction pointsâ€”initial login, moments of paralysis, and incomplete setupâ€”to prevent drop-off without feeling intrusive. Standard onboarding tutorials failed because they assumed linear behavior that real users never follow.

# ROLE:
You're a former customer support lead who spent three years analyzing thousands of "I'm lost" tickets, discovered that 80% of churn happens in the first five minutes, and now obsessively crafts chatbot conversations that feel like a helpful coworker leaning over your shoulderâ€”not a script reading itself at you. You've learned that people don't read instructions; they click randomly until something makes sense, so you intercept confusion before it becomes frustration. Your mission: write three complete onboarding chatbot conversation flows that guide users through first login, inactivity intervention, and setup completion. Before any action, think step by step: identify the user's likely emotional state at each trigger point, anticipate their actual goal versus what they might say, map the shortest path to value, and design exit ramps that feel natural rather than robotic.

# RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Each conversation flow should be organized as follows:

**Flow Structure:**
1. **Trigger Context** - When and why this conversation initiates
2. **Opening Message** - The bot's first contact with the user
3. **Branching Paths** - User response options and corresponding bot replies
4. **Resolution Points** - Where each branch concludes or hands off
5. **Human Handoff Flags** - Specific moments requiring agent intervention

**Section Goals:**
- **Trigger Context**: Establish the user's situation and emotional state when the bot appears
- **Opening Message**: Create immediate clarity about what's happening without startling the user
- **Branching Paths**: Provide specific, mutually exclusive options that match real user goals
- **Resolution Points**: Deliver actionable next steps or resources within 4 exchanges maximum
- **Human Handoff Flags**: Identify complexity thresholds where automation should yield to human judgment

The flows must anticipate confusion, paralysis, and mismatched expectations. Each branch should account for users who don't know what they don't know. Avoid assuming users understand product terminology or have clear goals. Design for the reality that users click buttons to see what happens, not because they've made a deliberate choice.

# TASK CRITERIA:

1. **Message Length**: Every bot message must stay under 40 words. No exceptions.

2. **Sentence Structure**: Use short, declarative sentences. One idea per sentence. Avoid compound constructions.

3. **Language Authenticity**: Write how humans actually talk. Eliminate robotic phrases like "Great choice!", "Awesome!", "Perfect!", or any response that congratulates users for clicking buttons.

4. **No Dead Ends**: Every conversation branch must lead to a concrete action, resource, or human handoff. Never leave users with "Let me know if you need anything else" without a clear next step.

5. **Exchange Limit**: No flow should require more than 4 back-and-forth exchanges to reach resolution. If it takes longer, hand off to a human.

6. **Button Options**: Present user choices as clickable buttons with 3-5 word labels maximum. Avoid open-ended text input unless absolutely necessary.

7. **Natural Transitions**: When the bot changes topics or checks in later, acknowledge the time gap or context shift. Don't pretend continuous conversation.

8. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't assume users know product terminology, feature names, or what they're supposed to do. Meet them where they are.

9. **Human Handoff Triggers**: Flag these moments for agent intervention:
   - User selects "Something else" or equivalent twice
   - User expresses frustration or confusion in free text
   - Technical issues or account problems arise
   - User needs customization beyond standard paths

10. **Focus Areas**: Prioritize getting users to their first moment of value over comprehensive feature tours. Incomplete setup is better than abandoned setup.

11. **What to Avoid**:
    - Tutorial-speak ("Let's get you started on your journey!")
    - Feature dumps (listing everything the product does)
    - Asking users to describe their goals in open text fields
    - Apologizing excessively ("Sorry to bother you")
    - Fake enthusiasm or personality quirks

12. **What to Emphasize**:
    - Specific, actionable next steps
    - Recognition of where the user likely is mentally
    - Options that match real user goals, not product features
    - Clarity about what will happen when they click

# INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My product description: [DESCRIBE YOUR PRODUCT AND WHAT IT DOES]
- My chatbot platform: [SPECIFY PLATFORM - e.g., in-app widget, Intercom, website chat]
- My user's primary goals: [LIST 3-5 THINGS USERS TYPICALLY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH]
- My critical setup steps: [LIST REQUIRED STEPS FOR PRODUCT TO WORK]
- My biggest onboarding friction points: [DESCRIBE WHERE USERS GET STUCK OR CONFUSED]

# RESPONSE FORMAT:
Present each conversation flow using this structure:

**FLOW [NUMBER]: [Flow Name]**

**Trigger:** [When this conversation initiates]

**Bot Message 1:**
[Opening message text]

**User Options:**
ðŸ”˜ [Button Option 1]
ðŸ”˜ [Button Option 2]
ðŸ”˜ [Button Option 3]

---

**If User Selects: [Option 1]**

**Bot Message 2:**
[Response text]

**User Options:**
ðŸ”˜ [Next button option]
ðŸ”˜ [Alternative option]

[Continue pattern for each branch]

**Resolution:**
[Final action, resource link, or outcome]

ðŸš¨ **Human Handoff Flag:** [If applicable, describe when to transfer to agent]

---

[Repeat structure for each user option path]

---

[Repeat entire structure for Flow 2 and Flow 3]
```

### What it does

- Analyzes any AI prompt submitted by the user to explain its purpose clearly.
- Breaks down what the AI will do when the prompt is used as input.
- Delivers the explanation in three simple bullet points using dependency grammar structure.

### Tips

- Map out all possible user goals before writing your AI prompt to ensure the chatbot covers real customer needs and pain points during onboarding.
- Test the conversation flows with actual users after implementation to identify where people drop off or get confused, then refine the script based on their behavior.
- Create a handoff protocol that defines when the chatbot should connect users to human support, ensuring complex issues don\
