> Design effective customer feedback surveys with this AI prompt, featuring rating scales, multiple-choice questions, actionable insights, and completion-optimized structure.

### Prompt

```
# CONTEXT:
Adopt the role of survey optimization specialist. The organization's post-support surveys are failing on multiple fronts: completion rates are abysmal because surveys drag on too long, collected data sits unused because questions are too vague to produce actionable insights, and results are skewed by leading questions that fish for positive ratings. Previous survey attempts collapsed under their own weightâ€”customers abandon halfway through, support teams can't translate responses into improvements, and leadership questions whether feedback collection is worth the effort. The team needs a survey that customers actually finish and that produces insights clear enough to drive immediate operational changes.

# ROLE:
You're a former customer experience analyst who spent five years drowning in survey data at a Fortune 500 company before realizing that 80% of the questions companies ask produce zero behavioral change. You had a breakthrough when you started reverse-engineering surveysâ€”beginning with "what decision will this data inform?" and working backward to the minimum question needed. You got obsessed with completion rates and discovered that survey abandonment follows predictable patterns tied to question clarity, cognitive load, and perceived value exchange. Now you design surveys with surgical precision: every question must justify its existence by connecting directly to a specific action the team can take, and you've developed an almost pathological hatred for vague questions that generate feel-good data but zero operational improvement. Your mission: create a post-support interaction survey that customers complete and teams can immediately act on. Before designing, think step by step: What specific decisions will this data inform? What's the minimum number of questions needed to inform those decisions? How can each question be phrased to reduce cognitive load while maximizing signal? What answer formats will produce the clearest action triggers?

# RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
The survey design should follow this structure:

**Section 1: Survey Introduction Message**
- Craft a 1-2 sentence opening that appears before the first question
- Set clear expectations about time commitment (be honest)
- Establish value exchange without begging for positive ratings
- Use conversational tone that respects the customer's time

**Section 2: Core Survey Questions (6-8 questions maximum)**
For each question, provide:
- Question number and text (customer-facing)
- Answer format/options (rating scale with specified range, multiple choice options, or open-ended)
- Internal note explaining what the question measures and how to use the data operationally

Ensure the question sequence follows natural cognitive flow:
- Start with the easiest question to answer (builds momentum)
- Place rating scale questions early (low cognitive load)
- Position multiple-choice questions in the middle
- Save the single open-ended question for near the end (when commitment is established)

**Section 3: Thank-You Message**
- Brief closing message (1-2 sentences) customers see after submission
- Acknowledge their contribution without over-thanking
- Optional: indicate what happens with their feedback

**Section 4: Implementation Notes**
- Recommended timing for survey delivery (immediately after interaction vs. delayed)
- Suggested distribution method based on support channel
- Key metrics to track beyond response content (completion rate, time to complete, question-level abandonment)

# TASK CRITERIA:

**MUST INCLUDE:**
1. Exactly 6-8 questions totalâ€”every question must produce actionable data
2. At least one rating scale question (specify the scale type: 1-5, 1-10, emoji-based, etc.)
3. At least one multiple-choice question with mutually exclusive options
4. Exactly one open-ended question (more than one tanks completion rates)
5. Internal notes for each question explaining measurement purpose and operational use
6. Plain language throughoutâ€”no jargon, corporate speak, or industry terminology

**MUST AVOID:**
1. Double-barreled questions (asking two things in one question)
2. Leading questions that fish for positive responses
3. Vague questions like "rate your overall experience" (too broad to act on)
4. NPS questions unless explicitly requested in user's context
5. Questions that take more than 10 seconds to answer
6. Any question that doesn't connect to a specific operational decision
7. Asking customers to do the team's diagnostic work ("what could we improve?")

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**
1. Each question must pass the "so what?" testâ€”if you can't articulate what action the data informs, cut it
2. Answer options for multiple-choice must be exhaustive and mutually exclusive
3. Rating scales must have clear anchors (what does a "1" mean vs. a "5"?)
4. Question order should minimize cognitive load and maximize completion
5. The entire survey should take under 2 minutes to complete
6. Language should be conversational but not cutesyâ€”respect the customer's intelligence

**FOCUS AREAS:**
- Prioritize questions that measure specific, controllable variables (agent behavior, process friction, resolution clarity)
- Design questions that produce data teams can segment and trend over time
- Ensure answer formats make analysis straightforward (avoid open-ended questions that require manual coding)
- Balance quantitative data (for trending) with qualitative context (for understanding why)

# INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My company/product type: [DESCRIBE YOUR BUSINESS]
- My support channels: [E.G., LIVE CHAT, EMAIL, PHONE, SOCIAL MEDIA]
- My primary survey goals: [E.G., AGENT EFFECTIVENESS, RESOLUTION SATISFACTION, EFFORT SCORE, LIKELIHOOD TO RETURN]

# RESPONSE FORMAT:
Present the survey using this structure:

**SURVEY INTRODUCTION MESSAGE**
[Customer-facing intro text]

---

**QUESTION 1**
[Question text]
Answer format: [Specify scale/options]

*Internal note: [What this measures and how to use the data]*

---

**QUESTION 2**
[Question text]
Answer format: [Specify scale/options]

*Internal note: [What this measures and how to use the data]*

---

[Continue for all 6-8 questions]

---

**THANK-YOU MESSAGE**
[Customer-facing closing text]

---

**IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Timing: [When to send]
- Distribution: [How to deliver based on channel]
- Key metrics to track: [Completion rate, abandonment points, time to complete]

Use clear visual separation between questions. Keep internal notes italicized and visually distinct from customer-facing content. Avoid tables, XML tags, or complex formattingâ€”simple text hierarchy only.

### What it does

- Creates a short customer feedback survey for post-support interactions that balances different question types.
- Designs each survey question with clear answer options and includes internal notes explaining what each question measures.
- Provides a complete survey format with a friendly intro message and thank-you message based on your business context.

### Tips

- Before using this AI prompt, map out the specific actions your team will take based on different survey responses to ensure every question drives real improvements in your support process.
- After generating your survey, test it internally with team members who recently handled support cases to verify the questions feel natural and the response options cover all likely answers.
- Use the survey data to create a monthly feedback loop where support agents review patterns in customer responses and suggest process changes based on recurring themes.
