  "main_prompt": "Create a single architectural presentation board image. TOP HALF: an ultra-photorealistic exterior visualization of a [HOUSE STYLE] with [BUILDING SPEC] levels, approx. [BUILDING SPEC], [BUILDING SPEC], in a [SITE CONTEXT]. Design language: rectilinear volumes with strong horizontal rooflines, deep window reveals, premium [MATERIAL PALETTE]. Include key features: [KEY FEATURE 1], [KEY FEATURE 2], [KEY FEATURE 3]. Add a calm landscaped yard and a refined courtyard/pool composition if specified. Realistic dusk/golden-hour lighting with warm interior glow through large black-framed glazing; crisp shadows; correct scale; no distortion; buildable structure; detailed facade joints.\n\nBOTTOM HALF: a clean architectural floor plan drawing panel that matches the SAME building exactly. If [BUILDING SPEC] is two levels, show TWO floor plans side-by-side Upper Floor right. If one level, show one plan centered. Use black linework on white background with consistent stroke weights, doors with swing arcs, windows, walls thickness, stairs where needed. Label every room in English and show room sizes in {units}. Keep the plan minimal and professional (like an architecture brochure). Ensure room arrangement is logically consistent with the exterior: double-height glazing corresponds to living room, courtyard/pool aligns with outdoor terrace, core placement matches.\n\nThe whole output must look like a real architecture presentation sheet: clean white margins, subtle small captions only. Do NOT add random text, fake logos, or unreadable typography. Everything must be sharp and readable.",

### What it does

- Generates a single AI image presentation board showing a photorealistic house exterior render on top and matching architectural floor plans below.
- Creates both views of the same building design with consistent features, ensuring the floor plan layout matches the exterior massing and window positions.
- Produces a professional architecture sheet with clean margins, readable room labels, and realistic dusk lighting for the exterior render.

### Tips

- Fill the house style variable with specific architectural movements like Modern Minimalist, Contemporary Farmhouse, or Mid-Century Modern to guide the AI image generation toward a cohesive design language.
- Choose material palettes that work together visually, such as charred timber with concrete and glass or white stucco with natural wood accents, ensuring the AI image prompt creates realistic texture combinations.
- Select key features that define your project\
