## 🎯 Quality Standards

We only accept prompts that meet the following criteria:

### Must Have

1. **Production-Tested** - The prompt must have been used in real work scenarios, not just theoretically designed
2. **Copilot-Specific** - Must work specifically with Microsoft Copilot (not generic AI prompts)
3. **Business Value** - Solves a real business problem or significantly improves productivity
4. **Clear Use Case** - Includes specific scenarios where the prompt is useful
5. **Target Audience** - Defines who would benefit from this prompt

### Nice to Have

- Multiple variations for different contexts
- Tips for customization
- Known limitations documented
- Examples of expected output

### Not Accepted

- Generic prompts that work the same on any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Prompts for personal/non-work use
- Prompts that could violate enterprise policies
- Prompts that attempt to bypass safety features
- Prompts with placeholder-only content (no actual substance)

## 📝 Prompt Format Requirements

All prompts must follow this exact structure:

```markdown
### [Prompt Number]. [Prompt Name]

**Use Case:** [Specific scenario where this prompt is useful]

**Target Personas:** [Job roles that would benefit, comma-separated]

**Tags:** `tag1`, `tag2`, `tag3`

**Prompt:**

Review all my emails, Teams messages, and meeting notes from the past week related to [Project Name]. Provide:

1. Progress highlights — what got done
2. Key issues raised — with who raised them
3. Decisions made or pending
4. Risks or concerns mentioned
5. Client/stakeholder feedback

## 🆘 Questions?

### Before Submitting

- **Is my prompt Copilot-specific?** If it works the same on ChatGPT without modification, it's probably too generic.
- **Have I tested it?** We require real-world testing, not theoretical prompts.
- **Does it add value?** Compare to existing prompts in the same category.

### Getting Help

- Open an **Issue** with the label "question"
- Tag maintainers in your PR if stuck
- Check existing issues for similar questions
