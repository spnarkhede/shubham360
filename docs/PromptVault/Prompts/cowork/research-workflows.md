## Meeting & Stakeholder Prep

### 6. Pre-Meeting Research Brief

**Use Case:** Walk into any meeting fully prepared — know what was last discussed, what's open, and what they're likely to raise.

**Target Personas:** Account Manager, Project Manager, Executive, Consultant

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `meeting-prep`, `outlook`, `teams`, `calendar`

**Prompt:**
```
I have a meeting with [Name] at [Company/Team] coming up. Search all my emails, Teams messages, and meeting notes involving them from the last 90 days. Produce a pre-meeting brief:
- The last 3 topics we discussed — newest first
- Any open items or commitments on either side — list each with the date it was raised
- The tone and direction of the last exchange — positive, tense, neutral, transactional
- One thing I should bring up proactively based on what you found

Show me the source messages you are drawing from before writing the brief, so I can verify accuracy. Keep the final brief under 150 words. Do not send or post anything.
```

**Schedulable:** No (requires [Name] variable)
**Skills used:** Email, Meetings, Enterprise Search
**Approval required:** No (read-only output)

---

### 7. Stakeholder Update — Multi-Step

**Use Case:** Prepare a structured stakeholder update by letting Cowork find the relevant content first, then draft from verified sources. The "show sources before drafting" instruction is the key line — without it, Cowork may skip straight to drafting.

**Target Personas:** Project Manager, Account Manager, Program Lead

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `stakeholder`, `agentic`, `outlook`, `teams`

**Prompt:**
```
I need to prepare a stakeholder update for [project or initiative name]. Do the following in sequence:

Step 1: Search my emails and Teams from the last 2 weeks for any updates, blockers, or decisions related to this project. Show me what you found — the actual message subjects, senders, and key content — before moving to Step 2.

Step 2: From what you found, identify the 3 most important developments to highlight.

Step 3: Draft a 5-bullet stakeholder update in this format:
- What happened (the facts)
- What is next (next actions and owner)
- What needs a decision (anything blocked waiting on someone)
- Key risks or concerns
- Suggested subject line for the email

Do not send anything. Present the draft for my review.
```

**Schedulable:** No (requires project name variable)
**Skills used:** Email, Teams, Communications
**Approval required:** Yes — review draft before sending

---

### 8. Post-Meeting Action Capture

**Use Case:** Immediately after a meeting, convert notes and transcript into assigned tasks and a recap email — without doing it manually.

**Target Personas:** Project Manager, Team Lead, Consultant, Executive Assistant

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `meeting-follow-up`, `teams`, `outlook`

**Prompt:**
```
I just finished a meeting with [attendees/team]. Search for the Teams meeting transcript or my notes from the last 2 hours. Produce:

1. A structured list of action items — each with: what needs to be done, who owns it, and any deadline mentioned
2. A recap email draft to all attendees with: key decisions made, action items with owners, open questions, and next meeting date if mentioned

Show me the action item list first. After I confirm it is accurate, show me the email draft. Do not send the email until I explicitly approve it and confirm the recipient list.
```

**Schedulable:** No
**Skills used:** Email, Meetings, Communications
**Approval required:** Yes — email send requires explicit approval

---

### 9. Executive Pre-Read

**Use Case:** Before meeting with a senior stakeholder or exec, get a concise picture of the relationship, recent context, and what they care about.

**Target Personas:** Account Manager, Business Developer, Project Manager, Consultant

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `executive`, `meeting-prep`, `outlook`, `teams`

**Prompt:**
```
I am meeting with [Name], [Title], at [Organisation] on [date]. Search my emails, Teams messages, and calendar entries involving them or their organisation from the last 6 months. Produce an executive pre-read:
- Last 3 topics or decisions involving them — what was the outcome of each
- Any open asks, commitments, or concerns on either side
- What they have said they care about or are focused on — use their exact words where possible, not paraphrases
- Any signals about priorities, pressures, or agenda items for this meeting

Keep this under 200 words. Do not send or post anything.
```

**Schedulable:** No
**Skills used:** Email, Meetings, Enterprise Search
**Approval required:** No (read-only output)

## Project & Portfolio Management

### 10. Project Status Digest — Across All Active Projects

**Use Case:** Get a cross-project status overview by letting Cowork sweep all recent communications rather than chasing each project lead.

**Target Personas:** PMO Director, Program Manager, Portfolio Lead

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `project-management`, `portfolio`, `outlook`, `teams`

**Prompt:**
```
Search my emails and Teams messages from the last 7 days. Across all active projects I am involved in, identify and summarise:
- Projects where something notable happened — decision, blocker, escalation, or milestone
- Projects that have gone quiet — no communication in the last 5+ days
- Any deadline or milestone mentioned that falls within the next 14 days
- Any open risk or issue flagged but not yet resolved

Group by project. For each project use maximum 3 bullet points. Flag any project that needs my attention this week. Do not send or post anything.
```

**Schedulable:** Yes — Monday 8:00 AM
**Skills used:** Email, Teams, Enterprise Search
**Approval required:** No (read-only output)

---

### 11. Risk and Blocker Sweep

**Use Case:** Surface every risk, blocker, or escalation mentioned across your communications before it reaches you in a meeting.

**Target Personas:** Project Manager, Program Lead, PMO

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `risk`, `blockers`, `outlook`, `teams`

**Prompt:**
```
Search my emails and Teams messages from the last 10 days. Find every instance where someone raised a risk, blocker, issue, delay, concern, or escalation — including phrases like "at risk", "blocked", "delayed", "concerned about", "issue with", "problem", "stuck", "waiting on". For each one:
- What is the risk or blocker
- Who raised it and when
- What project or workstream it relates to
- Whether there is any evidence it has been resolved

Sort by date — most recent first. Do not infer — only surface items explicitly stated in the communications. Do not send or post anything.
```

**Schedulable:** Yes — Friday 3:00 PM
**Skills used:** Email, Teams
**Approval required:** No (read-only output)

## Document Generation

### 12. Document from Meeting Notes

**Use Case:** Turn raw meeting notes or a transcript into a finished Word document — briefing, MOM, or decision record.

**Target Personas:** Project Manager, Executive Assistant, Consultant, Analyst

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `document`, `word`, `meeting-notes`

**Prompt:**
```
I am attaching my notes from [meeting name] on [date]. [Attach file]

Using these notes, create a Word document formatted as a Minutes of Meeting / Decision Record with:
- Meeting: name, date, attendees
- Context: one-paragraph summary of why this meeting was held
- Key decisions: each on its own line with the decision and who made it
- Action items: what needs to be done, who owns it, deadline if stated
- Open questions: items discussed but not resolved
- Next steps: agreed next meeting or follow-up date

Use formal but clear language. Do not invent content not in the notes — if something is unclear, flag it with [CLARIFY] rather than guessing. Save as a Word document and show me the draft before saving.
```

**Schedulable:** No
**Skills used:** Word, Meetings
**Approval required:** Yes — review before saving

---

### 13. Presentation from Brief

**Use Case:** Turn a written brief or set of bullet points into a structured PowerPoint deck.

**Target Personas:** Project Manager, Consultant, Executive, Sales

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `powerpoint`, `presentation`, `document`

**Prompt:**
```
I am attaching a brief for [presentation name / audience]. [Attach file]

Using this brief, create a PowerPoint presentation with the following structure:
- Slide 1: Title and context (what this presentation is and why it matters)
- Slides 2–4: The three main points — one key message per slide, supporting evidence below
- Slide 5: Implications or recommendations
- Slide 6: Next steps and owner for each

Use clean, minimal formatting. Each slide should have a single headline that stands alone as a sentence — not a label. Speaker notes on every slide with the key point to make verbally. Show me an outline of the slides before building the deck so I can confirm the structure.
```

**Schedulable:** No
**Skills used:** PowerPoint
**Approval required:** Yes — confirm outline before deck is built

## Research & Analysis

### 14. Deep Research — Multi-Source Synthesis

**Use Case:** Compile a research brief from both internal M365 data and external sources on a specific topic, company, or technology.

**Target Personas:** Consultant, Analyst, Business Developer, Executive

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `research`, `deep-research`, `enterprise-search`

**Prompt:**

I need a research brief on [topic, company, or technology]. Do the following in sequence:

Step 1: Search my emails, Teams, and SharePoint for any internal content we already have on this topic. Show me what you found before continuing.

Step 2: Search external sources for recent developments — focus on facts, announcements, and concrete data. No opinion pieces.

Step 3: Synthesise both into a research brief with:
- What we already know internally (from Step 1)
- What is new or has changed recently (from Step 2)
- The 3 most important things to understand about this topic right now
- Gaps — what we do not know that we should

Cite every source. Flag any claim you are not confident about with [VERIFY]. Do not send or post anything.
```

**Schedulable:** No (requires topic variable)
**Skills used:** Deep Research, Enterprise Search, Email, Teams

Search my emails and Teams messages from the last 90 days. Find every mention of a competitor, alternative solution, or vendor comparison — including company names, product names, and phrases like "evaluating alternatives", "looking at other options", "comparing with", "also talking to". For each mention:
- What was said and by whom

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `onboarding`, `stakeholder`, `research`

**Prompt:**
```
I am about to start working with [Name] who is joining [team/project/organisation]. Search my emails and Teams for any existing context about them — past exchanges, mentions by colleagues, or project history. Also search externally for their professional background.

## Calendar Management

### 17. Weekly Calendar Triage

**Use Case:** Delegate your weekly calendar review — surface conflicts, low-value meetings, and missing focus time — then approve changes.

**Target Personas:** Executive, Manager, Senior Individual Contributor

**Tags:** `cowork`, `frontier`, `calendar`, `time-management`, `schedulable`

**Prompt:**
```
Review my Outlook calendar for the next 7 days. Identify:
- Any scheduling conflicts — two or more events at the same time
- Meetings with no agenda or context in the invite that I own — list them so I can add context or cancel
- Days with no focus time (blocks of 90+ uninterrupted minutes) — suggest where to add focus blocks
- Any meeting I have accepted that appears low-value based on the invite content

For each issue you identify, propose a specific action: decline, reschedule, add focus block, or request agenda. Present all proposed changes for my approval before making any calendar modifications. Do not accept, decline, or reschedule anything without my explicit go-ahead for each item.
```

**Schedulable:** Yes — Sunday evening or Monday 6:30 AM (run before Monday briefing)
**Skills used:** Calendar Management, Scheduling
**Approval required:** Yes — all calendar changes require explicit approval

- New developments since the last meeting
- Open items from previous meeting notes that are still unresolved
- Anything I should raise proactively today
- One question worth asking the group

Keep this under 100 words. Deliver as a message to me only. Do not send or post to any other recipient.
