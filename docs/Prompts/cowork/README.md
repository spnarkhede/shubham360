# Copilot Cowork — Agentic Workflow Prompts

> 28 production-ready prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork. Cowork is the agentic execution layer inside M365 Copilot — you describe an outcome, Cowork plans the steps, searches across your Outlook, Teams, Calendar, and SharePoint, and executes the work with your approval at each action.

## How Cowork Prompts Differ from Chat Prompts

Chat and Cowork both search M365 data. That is not the difference.

The difference is what happens after the research. Chat hands you a draft and stops. Cowork can **send the email, schedule the meeting, post to Teams, create the calendar block** — with your explicit approval before each action. The prompts in [action-workflows.md](action-workflows.md) are where this distinction is visible.

**The Delegation Brief format — use this structure for every Cowork prompt:**

1. **Goal** — the outcome you want (not the steps)
2. **Inputs** — which M365 sources to pull from (Outlook, Teams, Calendar, SharePoint)
3. **Output** — what to produce and in what format
4. **Boundaries** — what not to do; what needs your approval before action is taken

**Show sources before drafting:** Include "show me what you found before moving to Step 2" in any multi-step prompt where accuracy matters. Cowork will pause after the search phase and display source messages before writing.

## Notes & Limitations

- **5 scheduled prompt limit** — treat each slot as a high-value decision. Recommended priority: Monday Briefing → Commitment Tracker → Calendar Triage → Project Digest → Daily Inbox Scan
- **Approval model** — Cowork shows a full preview before sending emails, posting to Teams, or modifying calendar events. Always verify recipients, content, and timing before approving
- **Attach files explicitly** — for document generation prompts, drag and drop the file rather than asking Cowork to find it from SharePoint (more reliable in current Frontier preview)
- **Custom skills** — for workflows you run frequently, save the prompt as a custom skill at `/Documents/Cowork/skills/` in OneDrive as a Markdown file. Up to 50 custom skills supported
- **EU tenants** — Cowork requires Anthropic models enabled. EU/EFTA tenants have Anthropic off by default — admin must enable separately in M365 Admin Center before Cowork is fully functional
