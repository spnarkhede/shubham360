# Copilot Cowork — Action-Taking Workflows

> These prompts do things Chat cannot. Chat drafts — Cowork executes. Every prompt here ends with Cowork taking an action (sending, scheduling, posting, creating) after showing you a full preview for approval.

[← Back to Cowork Collection](README.md) | [← Back to Main Collection](../../README.md)

## Requirements

> **REQUIRES:** Microsoft 365 Copilot licence + Frontier program enrolment + Anthropic sub-processor enabled. See [README.md](README.md) for full setup details.

## Why This Is Different

Both Copilot Chat and Cowork can search your emails, Teams messages, and SharePoint. That is not the difference.

The difference is what happens after the research. Chat produces a draft and stops. You have to copy it, open Outlook, paste it, check recipients, and send it yourself. Cowork can send the email, schedule the meeting, post to Teams, create the calendar block — with your explicit approval before each action.

Every prompt in this file completes an action. None of them stops at the draft.

For each one, draft a concise reply. Keep replies under 100 words unless the email requires a detailed response.

## Approval Model

Every prompt in this file requires at least one approval gate before Cowork takes action. The standard sequence is:

1. Cowork researches and drafts
2. Cowork shows you the full content + who it's going to
3. You approve (or edit, or reject)
4. Cowork executes

Never skip the preview step. "Approve All" for multi-action sequences should be used only when you have verified each action individually first.
