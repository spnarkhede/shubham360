# Beginner’s Guide

## 🛡️ Adblocking

👶 Imagine you’re walking in a park, and strangers keep shouting **“Buy this toy!”** even when you don’t want it. That’s how ads on bad websites behave. They can trick you into clicking the wrong thing.

So we use an **umbrella** (adblocker) to stay safe.

🔗 Tools:

* [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
* [Redirect Skipper](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/internet-tools/#wiki_.25B7_redirect_bypass)
* Mobile: [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-ios/overview.html) / [Rethink DNS](https://rethinkdns.com/app)

## 🌍 Browsers

👶 Think of a browser like a **car**. Some cars are safer, some are faster.
A **privacy car** keeps your secrets safe while driving on the internet road.
