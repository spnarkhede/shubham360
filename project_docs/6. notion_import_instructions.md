# How to Import Your Project Plan into Notion

This project plan is provided in Markdown format, which can be easily imported into Notion.

## Steps to Import:

1.  **Open Notion:** Go to your Notion workspace.
2.  **Create a New Page:** Click on `+ New page` in your sidebar or anywhere you want to add the plan.
3.  **Import File:** In the new (empty) Notion page, click on `Import` at the bottom of the page, or type `/import` and select `Markdown & CSV`.
4.  **Upload Markdown File:** Select the `project_plan.md` file from your computer.
5.  **Adjust Formatting (Optional):** Notion will convert the Markdown into its block-based editor. You may need to make minor adjustments to headings, lists, or tables to fully leverage Notion's features (e.g., converting task lists into Notion database items if desired).

This will create a new page in Notion with the full project plan, including analysis, brainstorming, and detailed tasks.
