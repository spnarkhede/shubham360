This document outlines the content, unique elements, and design considerations for each section of the advanced portfolio, focusing on making them stand out and engage specific visitor personas, now incorporating additional personal and social elements.

## 1. Landing Page: The Dynamic Gateway

**Goal:** To immediately capture attention, convey professionalism, and guide visitors to their relevant path without overwhelming them.

**Content:**
*   **Dynamic Hero Section:** A visually striking, subtle animation or video background (e.g., abstract code flow, cloud patterns, or a time-lapse of a project build). Not a static image.
