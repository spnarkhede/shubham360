              <p>
                Brianna Wiest’s "101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think" is a powerful collection that combines self-reflection, psychology, and modern philosophy. Each essay digs into the habits, beliefs, and emotions that shape how we perceive the world — and ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                From mental clarity to the importance of emotional intelligence, the book encourages the reader to pause, reassess, and grow. It's a book that doesn’t ask you to agree with everything, but it asks you to think deeper, challenge your biases, and become more conscious of your inner life.

              <h2 className="book-review-section-title">Key Takeaways</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>1. You Are What You Do Repeatedly</strong><br />
                Your habits shape your identity. Becoming who you want to be starts with acting like that person today.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Emotional Intelligence is Freedom</strong><br />
                Understanding your emotions and those of others is a superpower for modern living.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Growth is Often Quiet and Uncomfortable</strong><br />
                The most important progress doesn’t look glamorous. It’s often unseen and deeply personal.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. Self-Sabotage is Familiarity with Suffering</strong><br />
                Many people stay stuck not because they like it, but because it feels familiar.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Presence is Power</strong><br />
                The moment is the only place where change and clarity exist. Everything else is a distraction.

              <h2 className="book-review-section-title">Personal Reflection</h2>
              <p>
                This book felt like a deep conversation with a wise friend. Every essay made me pause and evaluate my thoughts, choices, and inner dialogue. I appreciated the honesty and simplicity with which Wiest explores complex emotions and behaviors.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s the kind of book you return to during different life phases, and each time, something new will hit you harder. It genuinely influenced the way I approach mindfulness and decision-making.
