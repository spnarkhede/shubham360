              <p>
                Brené Brown redefines modern leadership through her decade-long research on courage and vulnerability. This groundbreaking work argues that true leadership requires emotional exposure and risk-taking, challenging traditional notions of invulnerable authority. Brown presents practical tools for building trust, navigating difficult conversations, and creating cultures where innovation thrives through psychological safety.
              </p>
              <p>
                The book introduces the "Armored vs Daring Leadership" framework, demonstrating how vulnerability serves as a strength rather than a weakness. Through compelling case studies and personal stories, Brown shows how courageous leaders transform organizations by modeling authenticity and embracing uncertainty.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Armored vs Daring Leadership</strong><br />

              <p>
                <strong>5. Rumble with Vulnerability</strong><br />

              <p>
                Implementing Brown's principles required confronting my own perfectionism as a leader. The BRAVING framework helped me establish clearer boundaries while maintaining team trust. Initially uncomfortable with modeling vulnerability, I was surprised how sharing strategic uncertainties actually increased team problem-solving engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "rumble" concept transformed our conflict resolution - we now approach disagreements as shared investigations rather than battles. However, maintaining vulnerability in high-stakes situations remains challenging. Six months post-reading, our team's psychological safety scores improved by 40%, directly correlating with increased innovation output.
              </p>
              <p>
                Brown's research helped me reframe vulnerability as leadership armor rather than exposure. The most impactful shift has been replacing "What will people think?" with "How can I show up authentically?"
