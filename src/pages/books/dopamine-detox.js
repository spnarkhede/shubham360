              <p>
                Thibaut Meurisse presents a compelling blueprint for breaking free from the dopamine-driven cycles of modern life. The book explains how our brains have been hijacked by constant notifications, social media, and instant gratification, offering a structured approach to reset our neurological reward system. Through a combination of neuroscience insights and practical exercises, Meurisse guides readers in creating sustainable habits for deep focus and meaningful productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The detox program outlined in the book isn't about complete abstinence, but rather a strategic recalibration of how we engage with digital stimuli. Meurisse emphasizes gradual changes over extreme measures, making the methods accessible even for those deeply entrenched in digital addiction.

              <p>
                <strong>2. Stimulus Stacking</strong><br />
                Identifying and eliminating combinations of triggers that create addictive feedback loops.

              <p>
                Implementing the 72-hour reset was transformative but challenging. The first day felt like withdrawal, but by day three, I experienced mental clarity I hadn't felt in years. Meurisse's approach helped me recognize how I was using social media as a "dopamine slot machine" throughout my day.
              </p>
              <p>
                The environmental design strategies were particularly effective. By simply charging my phone outside the bedroom and using website blockers, I regained 90 minutes of productive morning time. However, maintaining these habits requires ongoing vigilance - the book wisely frames this as a lifestyle shift rather than a quick fix.
              </p>
              <p>
                While some methods felt initially extreme, the science-backed explanations helped me push through discomfort. Six months post-detox, I've sustained a 300% increase in deep work sessions and significantly reduced my screen time.
