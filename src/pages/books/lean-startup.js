              <p>
                Eric Ries' "The Lean Startup" introduces a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in an age of uncertainty. The methodology emphasizes rapid iteration, validated learning, and customer feedback over traditional business planning. Central to the philosophy is the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop, designed to help entrepreneurs continuously improve their products and business models.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ries challenges conventional wisdom about entrepreneurship, advocating for Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) over polished launches, and metrics that matter over vanity numbers. The book provides practical frameworks for deciding when to pivot (change strategy) or persevere, and introduces innovation accounting as a way to measure progress in uncertain environments.

              <h2 className="book-review-section-title">Key Takeaways</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong><br />
                Launch with the simplest version of your product that can test core assumptions, then iterate based on real user feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Validated Learning</strong><br />
                Use scientific experiments to prove business hypotheses rather than relying on untested assumptions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Build-Measure-Learn Loop</strong><br />
                Continuously cycle through building MVPs, measuring customer response, and learning what works.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. Innovation Accounting</strong><br />
                Track actionable metrics like conversion rates and customer retention instead of vanity metrics.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Pivot or Persevere</strong><br />
                Know when to change direction (pivot) based on data vs continuing with current strategy.

              <h2 className="book-review-section-title">Personal Reflection</h2>
              <p>
                This book fundamentally changed how I approach product development. Implementing MVP strategies helped me avoid wasting months on features users didn't want. The emphasis on actionable metrics versus vanity numbers was revelatory - I stopped obsessing over total downloads and focused instead on activation rates and retention.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pivot/persevere framework became a regular part of my team's quarterly reviews. While some concepts like "innovation accounting" felt initially abstract, applying them to real projects revealed their power in cutting through uncertainty.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, I found the strict lean approach sometimes conflicts with brand-building needs in competitive markets. The book works best when combined with other strategies - it's a powerful tool, not a complete playbook.
