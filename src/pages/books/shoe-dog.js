              <p>
                Phil Knight's memoir "Shoe Dog" offers an unflinching look at Nike's chaotic beginnings, from selling shoes from his car trunk in 1964 to building a global empire. The book reveals how Knight navigated constant financial crises, supplier betrayals, and legal battles while fostering a culture of innovation. Far from a polished success story, it's a gripping tale of perseverance featuring eccentric characters, disastrous miscalculations, and last-minute saves that shaped athletic history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knight's narrative captures the emotional rollercoaster of entrepreneurship - the paralyzing doubts, obsessive passion, and hard-won triumphs. The memoir doubles as a love letter to running and a testament to the power of trusting unconventional ideas.

              <p>
                <strong>1. Embrace the Grind</strong><br />
                Nike's success wasn't overnight - 14 years of near-bankruptcy, creative problem-solving, and relentless hustle.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. The Power of "Crazy Ones"</strong><br />
                Breakthrough innovations came from misfit employees encouraged to pursue seemingly irrational ideas.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Debt as a Survival Tool</strong><br />
                Knight's creative financial maneuvering (especially with Japanese banks) kept the company afloat during cash crunches.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. Brand Over Product</strong><br />
                Early focus on storytelling and athlete partnerships (like Steve Prefontaine) built emotional consumer connections.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>5. Loyalty Matters</strong><br />
                Long-term relationships with early employees and partners were crucial during existential crises.

              <h2 className="book-review-section-title">Personal Reflection</h2>
              <p>
                Reading "Shoe Dog" felt like getting a business education wrapped in an adventure novel. Knight's vulnerability about his doubts and fears made entrepreneurial success feel attainable rather than mythical. I was struck by how close Nike came to collapse multiple times - a reminder that even iconic companies have messy origin stories.
              </p>
              <p>
                The memoir inspired me to reframe challenges as necessary parts of growth rather than signs of failure. Knight's partnership with coach Bill Bowerman demonstrated the power of complementary skills - I've since been more intentional about seeking collaborators who balance my weaknesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the financial rollercoaster stressed me out vicariously, it highlighted the importance of creative problem-solving under pressure. The book's ending, reflecting on success's bittersweet nature, added poignant depth to the rags-to-riches narrative.
