              <p>
                Brandon Turner provides a comprehensive guide to building wealth through rental properties, covering everything from finding deals to managing tenants. The book emphasizes the "BRRRR" strategy (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat) and offers practical frameworks for analyzing property cash flow. Unlike generic real estate advice, Turner focuses on sustainable wealth-building through systems and scale.
              </p>
              <p>
                Updated for modern investors, the book includes strategies for remote landlording, working with property managers, and leveraging technology. The "Four Square Method" for evaluating deals and detailed mortgage calculations make this particularly valuable for avoiding common investment pitfalls.

              <h2 className="book-review-section-title">Personal Reflection</h2>
              <p>
                Applying the BRRRR strategy helped me acquire 3 properties with 75% recycled capital within 18 months. The 1% Rule prevented 2 bad purchases that seemed attractive superficially. However, Turner's maintenance estimates proved low in high-cost areas - adjusting CapEx to 25% preserved cash flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Implementing automated rent collection reduced late payments by 90%, but the suggested screening criteria rejected 80% of applicants in competitive markets. Balancing Turner's systems with local market nuances proved essential for success.
