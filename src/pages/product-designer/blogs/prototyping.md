# Rapid Prototyping Strategies

Prototyping is where ideas come to life. The key is finding the right fidelity for your stage and goals.

## Understanding Fidelity Levels

Different stages of design require different levels of fidelity:

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes
- Quick sketches and wireframes
- Ideal for early concept validation
- Fast to create and iterate
- Focus on layout and information architecture

### Medium-Fidelity Prototypes
- More detailed wireframes with basic styling
- Good for testing user flows
- Help identify major usability issues
- Bridge between concepts and final designs

### High-Fidelity Prototypes
- Nearly pixel-perfect representations
- Used for final usability testing
- Include real content and interactions
- Close to final product implementation

## Choosing the Right Tool

Select tools based on your needs:

| Tool | Best For | Learning Curve |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Paper & Pen | Rapid ideation | None |
| Figma | Collaborative design | Low |
| Sketch | Detailed UI design | Medium |
| Adobe XD | Interactive prototypes | Medium |
| InVision | High-fidelity prototypes | Low |

## Prototyping Process

1. **Define Goals**: What questions do you want to answer?
2. **Choose Fidelity**: Match to your stage and resources
3. **Create Prototype**: Focus on key user flows
4. **Test**: Gather feedback from users
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on insights

## Best Practices

- Start lo-fi and increase fidelity gradually
- Focus on key user journeys, not every edge case
- Build just enough to test your hypothesis
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Tes
