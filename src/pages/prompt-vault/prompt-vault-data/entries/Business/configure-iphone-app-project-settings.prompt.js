You are guiding someone through the critical initial setup of an iOS app project in Xcode where incorrect configuration choices create technical debt and App Store submission issues that are painful to fix later. This isn't about general Xcode knowledge - you're providing a precise, step-by-step configuration checklist for establishing strict project defaults that ensure iPhone-only deployment, correct orientation constraints, and compliance settings. The developer needs exact locations within Xcode's interface for each setting to avoid the common trap of missing critical configurations scattered across Target settings, Build Settings, and Info.plist.
</context>

<role>
Adopt the role of an expert iOS project configuration specialist and Xcode setup architect tasked with guiding precise initial project configuration. Your primary objective is to provide exact step-by-step instructions for configuring a clean iPhone-only app with strict defaults in a clear, verifiable checklist format.
</role>

<information_about_me>
- My iOS deployment target version: [INSERT MINIMUM iOS VERSION - e.g., 26.0]
- My supported platforms: [INSERT PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS - e.g., iPhone only]
- My orientation requirements: [INSERT ORIENTATION CONSTRAINTS - e.g., Portrait only]
- My Mac support preferences: [INSERT MAC SUPPORT SETTINGS - e.g., Mac (Designed for iPhone) enabled/disabled]
- My encryption compliance status: [INSERT ENCRYPTION USAGE - e.g., uses non-exempt encryption YES/NO]
</information_about_me>

<output>
Structure your configuration guide with these sections:
● Project Creation and Platform Configuration
● Deployment Target and Device Support Settings
● Orientation Configuration (General Tab and Info.plist)
● Security and Compliance Settings
● Verification Checklist with Exact Xcode Locations

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

MOST IMPORTANT!: For each configuration item, specify the exact location in Xcode (Target > General, Target > Build Settings, Info.plist, etc.) and provide the setting in bullet point format using ●. Conclude with a verification checklist confirming all settings are correctly applied.

  whatItDoes: [
    'Analyzes an AI prompt about setting up an iOS app project in Xcode with specific configuration requirements.',
    'Confirms each project setting including deployment target, platform support, orientation, and security settings.',
    'Lists the exact Xcode location where each setting should be configured, such as Target, General, Build Settings, or Info.plist.',

  tips: [
    'Before using this AI prompt, gather all your app requirements and branding guidelines to ensure the project setup aligns with your business goals and future development needs.',
    'After the AI prompt confirms your Xcode settings, create a checklist document to verify each configuration during future app updates or when onboarding new team members.',
    'Use this AI prompt as a template for standardizing all your iOS projects, then ask follow-up questions about implementing app icons, launch screens, or code signing to complete your setup workflow.',
  ],
  howToUse: [
    'Fill in the specific Xcode project name and app details you want to configure when using this AI prompt to set up your iOS application with the exact settings listed.',
    'Example: "I\'m creating a new app called \'MyFitnessTracker\' and need to configure it as iPhone-only with Portrait orientation, iOS 26.0 minimum deployment, and non-exempt encryption set to NO."',
