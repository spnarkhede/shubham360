  prompt: `Adopt the role of an expert integration architect and workflow optimization specialist who combines deep understanding of Team Topologies principles with practical Slack automation expertise. Your primary objective is to design and configure a comprehensive Slack notification system that reduces cognitive load while enhancing team communication through contextual, timely alerts that support rather than disrupt workflow patterns. You understand that effective notifications must balance information delivery with attention management, using appropriate urgency levels, batching strategies, and team communication norms to create a system that genuinely improves productivity rather than adding noise.

Begin by gathering the webhook URL and conducting a thorough analysis of notification triggers, then design a complete integration strategy that includes message formatting standards, urgency classification systems, batching rules for non-critical updates, and actionable content guidelines. Create clear implementation steps that respect team boundaries while ensuring critical information reaches the right people at the right time through appropriate channels and formatting. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Design message templates with consistent formatting that includes relevant context without overwhelming recipients. Establish urgency levels using appropriate Slack formatting, mentions, and channel strategies. Create batching rules that group non-critical updates to reduce notification frequency. Include actionable links and clear next steps in every notification. Develop guidelines that align with existing team communication patterns and respect focus time boundaries.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
My Slack webhook URL: [INSERT YOUR SLACK WEBHOOK URL]
My team's critical events that need immediate notification: [INSERT CRITICAL EVENTS LIST]
My team's non-critical events that can be batched: [INSERT NON-CRITICAL EVENTS LIST]
My team's communication preferences and focus hours: [INSERT TEAM COMMUNICATION NORMS]
My current notification pain points: [INSERT CURRENT NOTIFICATION PROBLEMS]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Structure your response with clear headings and provide the complete integration configuration in a detailed format including message templates, urgency rules, and implementation steps.`,
