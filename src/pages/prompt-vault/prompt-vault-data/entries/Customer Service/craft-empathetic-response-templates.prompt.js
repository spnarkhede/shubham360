  prompt: `##PHASE 1: Analyzing Common Scenarios
- **Objective:** Understand frequent customer service issues to empathize with customers.
- **Your Input Needed:** None
- **Actions:**
  1. Identify 5-7 common issue types using customer service data (e.g., billing disputes, technical issues).
  2. For each issue, use empathy mapping to outline emotional triggers and key pain points.
  3. Categorize issues based on scenario frequency and complexity.
- **Success Looks Like:** A clearly defined list of scenarios with emotional insights ready for template development.
- **Ready for next? Type "continue"**

##PHASE 2: Template Development
- **Objective:** Craft empathetic response templates for identified scenarios.
- **Your Input Needed:** None
- **Actions:**
  1. Create 2-3 template variations per scenario.
  2. Structure each with an opening acknowledgment, reflective listening phrases, clear solutions, and a call-to-action.
  3. Ensure the language is warm, validating, and supportive, while remaining professional and concise (150-200 words).
- **Success Looks Like:** A set of adaptable, empathetic templates for each common issue.
- **Ready for next? Type "continue"**

##PHASE 3: Incorporating Active Listening
- **Objective:** Enhance templates with active listening techniques.
- **Your Input Needed:** None
- **Actions:**
  1. Embed techniques such as paraphrasing, open-ended questions, and text-based non-verbal cues.
  2. Train agents to mirror customer sentiments accurately without interrupting.
  3. Simplify psychology terms to enhance agent understanding and application.
- **Success Looks Like:** Enhanced templates that demonstrate active listening and empathy, improving agent capacity to de-escalate situations.
- **Ready for next? Type "continue"**

##PHASE 4: Simulation Creation
- **Objective:** Develop real-world training simulations using crafted templates.
- **Your Input Needed:** None
- **Actions:**
  1. Generate scripted dialogues for each template: start with a customer complaint and include agent responses.
  2. Use branching interactions for different customer reactions and outcomes.
  3. Ensure each interaction ends with a positive resolution and showcases the application of templates.
- **Success Looks Like:** A library of training simulations that effectively demonstrate practical use of response templates.
- **Ready for next? Type "continue"**

##PHASE 5: Refining for Effectiveness
- **Objective:** Test and refine templates and simulations for real-world effectiveness.
- **Your Input Needed:** None
- **Actions:**
  1. Internally simulate outcomes to ensure alignment with best practices like the HEARD model.
  2. Adapt templates based on feedback, ensuring they're realistic, empathetic, and maintain a warm yet professional tone.
  3. Set metrics for measuring success, such as response time reductions, escalation rate reduction, and empathy ratings.
- **Success Looks Like:** Refined templates and simulations that are tested, validated, and ready for agent training and use.
- **Completion:** Outputs ready to empower agents with confidence and competence in handling customer issues effectively.

##SUMMARY: Key Takeaways for Implementation
- **Metrics for Success:**
  - Measurement of response time reductions
  - Tracking reductions in escalation rates
  - Monitoring improvements in customer empathy ratings
  - Evaluating increased customer satisfaction scores (CSAT)
- **Objective for Agents:** Equip with tools for proactive, human-centered service to foster trust and loyalty, ultimately reducing churn and enhancing customer relationships.`,
