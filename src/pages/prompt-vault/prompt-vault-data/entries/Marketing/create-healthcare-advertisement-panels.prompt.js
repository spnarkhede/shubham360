## VARIABLES GUIDE

| Variable | Description | Example Values | Dependency Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **[CLINIC NAME]** | Healthcare provider brand name | \`SMILECRAFT\`, \`VIVIDCARE\`, \`NEXTHEALTH\` | Appears in Objective and Branding block. Also requires updating \`Branding.Tagline\` to match new specialty. Pure name swap otherwise. |
| **[HEALTHCARE SPECIALTY]** | The specific medical or wellness service being advertised | \`Dental Clinic\`, \`Dermatology Center\`, \`Physiotherapy Studio\` | **Extreme coupling — the deepest in the healthcare context.** Changes the professional role in every panel, the equipment visible, the facility environment, the procedure depicted, the patient outcome visualization, AND the trust-signaling visual cues. See full cascade guide, patient journey mapping, and trust-signal architecture below. |
| **[COLOR PALETTE]** | Array of 3 brand colors defining visual identity | \`["Dental Blue", "White", "Soft Mint"]\`, \`["Warm Coral", "Cream White", "Blush Pink"]\`, \`["Sage Green", "White", "Light Tan"]\` | Must be provided as a JSON array of 3 color strings. **Healthcare trust constraint.** Medical advertising has a narrower palette tolerance than any previous prompt category. Colors must simultaneously feel clinical (clean, hygienic) and approachable (warm, not sterile). See healthcare palette science below. |

### Cascade Guide for [HEALTHCARE SPECIALTY]

This cascade operates differently from product-based prompts. Changing a product swaps what the camera points at. Changing a healthcare specialty swaps the entire professional context: who's in the room, what they're doing, what equipment is visible, what the patient experiences, and what "success" looks like.

**Layer 1: Service Description Cascade**

| Field Path | Original Value | What to Update | Coupling Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| \`Service_Description.Core_Services\` | Dental-specific array (checkups, cleaning, cosmetic, whitening) | Replace entirely with specialty-relevant services | **Critical** |
| \`Service_Description.Clinic_Features\` | Dental-specific features (sterilized equipment, dental imaging, patient care, certified professionals) | Replace equipment and imaging references; "comfort-focused patient care" and "certified professionals" transfer universally | High |

**Layer 2: Scene Bible Cascade**

| Field Path | Original Value | What to Update | Coupling Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| \`Background_Design.Environment\` | "Bright modern dental clinic interior" | Replace specialty reference; keep "bright modern" — universal healthcare positive signal | Medium |
| \`Background_Design.Color_Theme\` | ["Soft White", "Light Blue", "Mint Green"] | May transfer for most medical specialties. Dermatology and wellness may shift warmer. See dual-color architecture note below. | Medium |

**Layer 3: Panel Array Cascade — The Patient Journey**

Every panel rewrites because each represents a stage of a specialty-specific patient experience:

| Panel | Original Content | What to Update | Coupling Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Panel 1: Consultation** | "Dentist smiling and speaking with patient in modern clinic room" | Replace professional role title. Update interaction context (dermatologist examining skin, physio assessing movement, optometrist reviewing chart). | **Critical** |
| **Panel 2: Treatment** | "Close-up of dentist performing careful dental procedure with gloves and mask" | Replace procedure type, visible equipment, and protective gear appropriate to specialty. | **Critical** |
| **Panel 2: Focus** | "Sterile tools and modern equipment" | Replace with specialty-specific equipment (dermatoscope, therapy bands, eye examination tools) | **Critical** |
| **Panel 3: Result** | "Confident adult smiling naturally with bright teeth" | Replace outcome visualization. This is the hardest panel to swap because "healthy smile" is universally readable, but other specialties have less visually obvious results. See outcome visualization challenge below. | **Critical** |

**Layer 4: Technical and Branding Updates**

| Field Path | Original Value | When to Update |
|---|---|---|
| \`Branding.Tagline\` | "Your Healthiest Smile Starts Here" | **Always.** Tagline is dental-specific. Must be rewritten for every specialty. |
| \`Camera_And_Lighting.Shot_Types\` | ["Consultation mid-shot", "Procedure close-up", "Smile portrait"] | Update "Smile portrait" to specialty-appropriate result shot ("clear skin portrait," "movement demonstration," "vision test") |
| \`Camera_And_Lighting.Photography_Type\` | "Professional healthcare photography" | Transfers universally |
| \`Visual_Style.Style_Keywords[1]\` | "Modern clinic photography" | Transfers universally |
| \`Negative_Prompt[3]\` | "Unrealistic white teeth glow" | Replace with specialty-specific quality failure ("airbrushed skin" for derm, "exaggerated flexibility" for physio) |
| \`Negative_Prompt[0]\` | "Dirty instruments" | Transfers universally for clinical specialties; replace with equivalent for wellness/non-clinical services |

### Patient Journey Architecture: The 3-Panel Trust Funnel

This prompt's 3-panel structure encodes a specific psychological narrative designed to convert healthcare skeptics into patients. Each panel addresses a different trust barrier:
\`\`\`
Panel 1: CONSULTATION         Panel 2: TREATMENT           Panel 3: RESULT
"Will they listen to me?"  →  "Are they competent?"     →  "Will I get results?"
├─ Trust barrier: Fear      ├─ Trust barrier: Competence  ├─ Trust barrier: Outcome
├─ Visual cue: Smile,       ├─ Visual cue: Equipment,     ├─ Visual cue: Patient
│  eye contact, warmth       │  sterility, precision        │  confidence, health
└─ Mood: Trust, Comfort      └─ Mood: Precision, Hygiene   └─ Mood: Confidence, Health
\`\`\`

This funnel structure transfers to any healthcare specialty because the trust barriers are universal. What changes is the specific visual encoding of each barrier.

### Specialty Swap Mapping Table

| Healthcare Specialty | Panel 1: Consultation | Panel 2: Treatment | Panel 3: Result | Tagline Suggestion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dental Clinic** (original) | Dentist conversing with patient in exam room | Close-up of dental procedure with sterile tools | Confident smile with bright teeth | "Your Healthiest Smile Starts Here" |
| **Dermatology Center** | Dermatologist examining patient's skin with dermatoscope | Close-up of skin treatment (laser, microneedling, or topical application) | Clear, glowing skin portrait in natural light | "Your Healthiest Skin Starts Here" |
| **Physiotherapy Studio** | Physio discussing recovery plan with patient beside equipment | Close-up of guided movement therapy or joint treatment | Patient demonstrating confident, pain-free movement | "Move Freely, Live Fully" |
| **Optometry Clinic** | Optometrist speaking with patient at slit lamp | Close-up of eye examination or lens fitting | Person wearing new glasses with confident expression | "See the World More Clearly" |
| **Chiropractic Center** | Chiropractor reviewing spine imaging with patient | Close-up of spinal adjustment with proper positioning | Patient standing tall with relaxed, comfortable posture | "Align Your Health, Elevate Your Life" |
| **Veterinary Clinic** | Vet greeting pet owner and animal warmly | Close-up of careful examination of animal | Happy pet with relieved, smiling owner | "Where Healthy Pets Come First" |

### The Outcome Visualization Challenge (Panel 3)

Panel 3 is the hardest panel to swap because dental advertising has an inherent visual advantage: a smile is universally readable as a positive health outcome in a single photograph. Most other healthcare specialties don't have an equally instant visual result.

| Specialty | Outcome Visibility | Panel 3 Difficulty | Visual Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dental** (original) | **Instant** — smile reads in milliseconds | Low | Direct result portrait (smile) |
| **Dermatology** | **High** — clear skin is visible and aspirational | Low | Direct result portrait (glowing skin) |
| **Optometry** | **Medium** — glasses are visible but "better vision" is invisible | Medium | Show confidence wearing new frames; can't show "sharper vision" directly |
| **Physiotherapy** | **Low** — "less pain" and "better mobility" are invisible states | High | Show movement/activity that implies recovered function (walking freely, stretching comfortably) |
| **Chiropractic** | **Very Low** — "aligned spine" is invisible | High | Show posture improvement and relaxed body language as proxy for internal alignment |
| **Mental Health** | **Invisible** — emotional wellbeing has no direct visual marker | Very High | Show calm, present, connected expression. Risk of cliché (person staring at sunset). Consider replacing Panel 3 entirely with a supportive environment shot instead. |

**Invisible outcome workaround:** For specialties where the result is invisible (physio, chiropractic, mental health), shift Panel 3 from "result portrait" to "life-after-treatment moment" — show the patient doing something they couldn't do before, rather than displaying the medical outcome directly.

### Healthcare Palette Science

Medical advertising operates within a narrower color tolerance than any other prompt category in the series. Colors carry specific psychological signals in healthcare contexts:

| Color Family | Healthcare Signal | Safe For | Dangerous For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Light Blue** | Clinical trust, sterility, calm | All medical specialties — universal healthcare positive | Overuse → cold, institutional feeling |
| **Mint/Soft Green** | Healing, freshness, hygiene | Dental, dermatology, general practice | Dark green → surgical/operating room association |
| **White** | Cleanliness, precision, sterility | All specialties (must be primary or secondary, never absent) | Alone → sterile and unwelcoming |
| **Warm Coral/Blush** | Approachability, warmth, caring | Wellness-adjacent specialties (dermatology, aesthetic, pediatric) | Surgery, emergency, clinical labs (too soft for serious medical) |
| **Sage/Earth tones** | Natural, holistic, calm | Physiotherapy, chiropractic, naturopathic, wellness | Acute medical services (too casual for clinical trust) |
| **Deep Navy** | Authority, expertise, premium | Specialist clinics, surgical centers | Pediatric, family practice (too formal/intimidating) |

**Healthcare palette rules:**
1. White must always be one of the three colors — its absence signals lack of cleanliness
2. At least one color must be cool-toned (blue, mint, teal) — warm-only palettes feel non-medical
3. Saturated or neon colors are incompatible with healthcare trust — they read as commercial/retail rather than clinical
4. Black is absent from every viable healthcare palette — it signals mourning, fear, or severity

### Dual-Color Architecture (Unique to This Template)

This is the only prompt in the series with two independent color systems:
\`\`\`
Background_Design.Color_Theme    →  Controls clinical environment appearance
["Soft White", "Light Blue", "Mint Green"]    (universal medical cleanliness signals)
                    │
                    │  (operate independently)
                    │
Branding.Color_Palette           →  Controls brand identity overlay
["Dental Blue", "White", "Soft Mint"]         (brand differentiation within medical space)`,
