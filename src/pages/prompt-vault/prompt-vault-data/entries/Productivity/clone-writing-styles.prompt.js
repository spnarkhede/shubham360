  prompt: `##PHASE 1: Text Sample Acquisition

###Opening:
For this task, I will guide you in cloning a specific writing style with precision. Our method involves analyzing and replicating the stylistic DNA of a given text sample.

###Your Objective:
Provide a text sample (500+ words minimum) of the style you want to clone.

###What We're Doing:
Requesting a representative text sample to begin analysis.

###Transition:
Once you provide the text, we’ll move to the next phase where we'll break down the style.

##PHASE 2: Style Analysis

###Opening:
Having received the text sample, we will now meticulously analyze its style.

###Research Needs:
Utilizing advanced linguistic analysis tools.

###User Input:
Not needed for this phase.

###Processing:
- Examine sentence rhythm (short vs long patterns).
- Measure punctuation density (commas, dashes, periods per 100 words).
- Evaluate word complexity (simple vs technical vocabulary).
- Calculate paragraph length (average sentences per paragraph).
- Identify tone markers (formal, casual, direct, conversational).
- Detect signature phrases or verbal tics.

###Output:
- Simple breakdown of style DNA.
- Metrics presented for each characteristic analyzed.

###Transition:
Ready to clone this style? Proceed to the next phase.

##PHASE 3: Style Application

###Opening:
Armed with the style DNA, we will now apply it to a new topic of your choosing.

###User Input:
Provide a new topic to write about using this cloned style.

###Processing:
Generate a 300-word piece on the topic, meticulously matching the analyzed metrics.

###Output:
- New text demonstrating the cloned style.

###Transition:
Let's review the results side-by-side for accuracy.

##PHASE 4: Results Comparison

###Opening:
Perform a comparison of the original and cloned metrics for accuracy verification.

###Processing:
- Side-by-side comparison of original sample metrics and your output metrics.
- Calculate accuracy percentage.

###Output:
- Detailed comparison report.
- Show percentage of style accuracy attained.

###Transition:
Evaluate if further refinement or a new analysis is desired.

##PHASE 5: Refinement or New Analysis

###Opening:
Decide on next steps to refine the clone, or undertake a new style analysis.

###User Input:
Do you want to refine the clone or analyze a different style?

###Processing:
Adjust cloning parameters if refining.
Initiate new analysis if desired.

###Output:
- Refined text if chosen.
- Starter guide for new analysis.

###Transition:
Confirm readiness for further actions or conclude.`,
  whatItDoes: [
    'Guides through a writing style analysis workflow with sample submission and cloning phases.',
    'Collects text samples, analyzes linguistic patterns, and gathers new topic preferences through structured questions.',
    'Delivers style-matched content with metric comparisons and accuracy scoring for the cloned writing.',
  ],
  tips: [
    'Prepare at least three writing samples from the same author before starting this AI prompt, ensuring each exceeds 500 words to give the analysis enough data patterns to identify consistent style markers.',
    'During the analysis phase, add context about where the writing appears and who reads it, as this helps the AI prompt understand the purpose behind style choices rather than just copying surface patterns.',
    'After receiving your cloned writing sample, test it with someone familiar with the original style to catch nuances the metrics missed, then run the AI prompt again with adjustment notes.',
  ],
  howToUse: [
    'Run the full prompt and follow the guided questions with detailed answers, starting by providing a text sample of 500+ words minimum for analysis.',
    'Example: "Text sample: [paste 500+ word article/blog post], New topic request: sustainable fashion trends, Refinement preference: match conversational tone more closely"',
