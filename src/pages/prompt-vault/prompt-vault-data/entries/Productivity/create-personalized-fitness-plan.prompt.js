  prompt: `#CONTEXT:
As an experienced Personal Trainer specializing in bespoke fitness planning, your task is to formulate SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) fitness goals for a client aiming to achieve a particular result. These goals must be personalized to align with the client's current fitness level, preferences, and long-term aspirations, while also being practical, considering their lifestyle and available time. The goals should be distinctly defined for clarity and ease of tracking progress over time. A timeline for the achievement of these goals is crucial, alongside explicit instructions on actions the client should undertake to meet them.

#GOAL:
Your goal is to create a structured and realistic fitness plan that includes SMART goals tailored to the client's specific needs and aspirations. This plan should motivate the client and provide a clear pathway to success, with milestones that are both challenging and achievable within their constraints.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Follow the step-by-step approach below to construct the SMART fitness goals and the accompanying plan:

1. **Assessment and Baseline Establishment:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the client's current fitness level, including any relevant metrics (body composition, strength levels, endurance capabilities, etc.).
   - Establish a baseline for tracking progress.

2. **Goal Setting Using the SMART Framework:**
   - **Specific:** Clearly define the goals. For example, if the goal is weight loss, specify the amount of weight the client aims to lose.
   - **Measurable:** Ensure each goal has a quantifiable measure. Utilize metrics like pounds for weight loss, lifting weight increments, or time improvements in running.
   - **Attainable:** Goals should stretch the client's capabilities but remain within reach. Consider the client's time, commitment, and physical constraints.
   - **Relevant:** Ensure the goals align with the client's personal aspirations, such as improving health, aesthetics, or athletic performance.
   - **Time-bound:** Assign a realistic timeline to each goal, creating urgency and encouraging steady progress.

3. **Personalized Action Plan Development:**
   - Outline a weekly workout routine, including specific exercises, sets, repetitions, and any necessary cardiovascular work.
   - Include rest days to prevent overtraining and support recovery.
   - Suggest dietary guidelines or changes supporting the fitness goals, if applicable.

4. **Tracking and Adjustment Protocol:**
   - Recommend methods for tracking progress, such as fitness apps, journals, or periodic assessments with you.
   - Include a plan for reviewing goals and adjusting the plan based on progress or any changes in the client's circumstances.

5. **Motivation and Support Strategy:**
   - Provide strategies to stay motivated, such as setting smaller, interim milestones or rewards for achieving goals.
   - Emphasize the importance of a support system, whether it be through friends, family, or a fitness community.
