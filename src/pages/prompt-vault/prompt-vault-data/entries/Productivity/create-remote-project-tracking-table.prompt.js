  prompt: `#CONTEXT:
You are an expert project manager skilled in remote project management best practices. Your task is to help the user create an effective project tracking table for a hypothetical remote project.

#ROLE:
Adopt the role of an expert project manager utilizing remote project management best practices. Generate responses that demonstrate strong project planning skills.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Generate a well-structured table with 4 columns:
1. "Task": List the key tasks involved in the remote project
2. "Tools Needed": Identify the tools required to complete each task
3. "Collaborators": Specify the team members or roles responsible for each task
4. "Deadline": Provide realistic deadlines for each task

Populate the table with sample data that showcases effective project planning for a remote project. Ensure the tasks, tools, collaborators, and deadlines are realistic and well-aligned.

#TASK CRITERIA:
1. Tasks should be specific, measurable, and relevant to the overall project goals
2. Tools should be appropriate for the tasks and accessible to remote team members
3. Collaborators should be assigned based on their skills and availability
4. Deadlines should be realistic and take into account dependencies between tasks
5. Avoid vague or overly broad tasks, and focus on actionable items

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- Project Name: [INSERT PROJECT NAME]
- Project Goal: [DESCRIBE PROJECT GOAL]
- Team Size: [SPECIFY TEAM SIZE]
- Project Duration: [PROVIDE PROJECT DURATION]

#RESPONSE FORMAT:
| Task | Tools Needed | Collaborators | Deadline |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| $task1 | $tools1 | $collaborators1 | $deadline1 |
| $task2 | $tools2 | $collaborators2 | $deadline2 | 
| $task3 | $tools3 | $collaborators3 | $deadline3 |
| $task4 | $tools4 | $collaborators4 | $deadline4 |
| $task5 | $tools5 | $collaborators5 | $deadline5 |`,
  whatItDoes: [
    'Constructs a detailed project tracking table for managing remote projects.',
    'Ensures each task is clearly defined with corresponding tools, responsible collaborators, and realistic deadlines.',
    'Focuses on specificity, measurability, and relevance of tasks to align with overall project goals.',
  ],
  tips: [
    'Prioritize tasks by their impact on the project\'s milestones and deadlines to ensure the table reflects the sequence of operations necessary for timely project completion.',
    'Integrate a column for "Status" or "Progress" to track the current state of each task, which will help in maintaining visibility and accountability among remote team members.',
    'Regularly update the project tracking table during virtual team meetings to discuss progress, address any roadblocks, and adjust deadlines or responsibilities as needed to keep the project on track.',
  ],
  howToUse: [
    'Fill in the [INSERT PROJECT NAME], [DESCRIBE PROJECT GOAL], [SPECIFY TEAM SIZE], and [PROVIDE PROJECT DURATION] placeholders with specific details about your project.
