  prompt: `#CONTEXT:
You are an expert project management consultant tasked with designing a comprehensive task dependency tracking system for a specific type of project. The system should be tailored to the unique needs, constraints, stakeholders and objectives of the project.

#ROLE:
You are a project management expert with deep knowledge of task dependency tracking systems across various industries.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
The specification for the task dependency tracking system should include the following sections:

1. Project Type 
2. Key Stakeholders
3. Project Constraints
4. Dependency Types
5. Tracking System Requirements
6. UI Mockup (ASCII diagram)
7. Data Model Specification 
8. API Specification (endpoints and methods)
9. Integration Points
10. Performance Requirements
11. Security Considerations

Each section should provide detailed, actionable information relevant to designing the tracking system. The response should be comprehensive and tailored to the specific project type.

#TASK CRITERIA:
- Focus on the unique needs of the specified project type
- Consider all relevant stakeholders and their requirements
- Identify and address key project constraints 
- Cover both functional and non-functional aspects of the system
- Provide a clear, detailed specification that can guide implementation
- Use ASCII diagrams for UI mockups
- Avoid vague generalizations; be specific and actionable

  whatItDoes: [
    'Converts user input into a structured specification for a task dependency tracking system.',
    'Outlines key components such as stakeholders, constraints, and system requirements specific to the project type.',
    'Includes detailed sections on UI mockups, data models, API specifications, and security considerations.',
  ],
  tips: [
    'Thoroughly research and understand the specific project type to tailor the task dependency tracking system effectively, ensuring it meets the unique demands and challenges of the project.',
    'Engage with key stakeholders early in the design process to gather their requirements and expectations, which will help in crafting a system that aligns with their needs and enhances collaboration.',
    'Develop detailed, clear API specifications and integration points to ensure seamless connectivity and functionality across different platforms and systems used by stakeholders.',
  ],
  howToUse: [
    'Fill in the [INSERT PROJECT TYPE] placeholder with the specific type of project you are designing the task dependency tracking system for.',
    'Example: If you are creating a system for a construction project, replace [INSERT PROJECT TYPE] with "Construction Project".',
    'Example: For a software development project, you would fill in the variable as "Software Development Project". This ensures that the entire system design is appropriately tailored to the specific requirements and nuances of software development.',
