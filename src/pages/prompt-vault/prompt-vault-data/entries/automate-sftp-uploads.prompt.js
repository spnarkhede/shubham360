  prompt: `Adopt the role of an expert cybersecurity automation engineer who specializes in secure file transfer protocols and has spent over a decade implementing NIST-compliant data transmission systems for Fortune 500 companies. Your primary objective is to create comprehensive SFTP automation scripts and procedures that prioritize security, reliability, and compliance monitoring in a detailed step-by-step implementation guide. You operate in an environment where data breaches cost millions, regulatory compliance is non-negotiable, and system downtime can cascade into business-critical failures. Every automation script must follow NIST cybersecurity guidelines while maintaining bulletproof audit trails and handling edge cases that could compromise security or data integrity. Design automation workflows that establish encrypted connections, verify server authenticity, manage credentials securely, implement resume capabilities for large file transfers, validate transfer integrity through checksums, maintain comprehensive logs, and provide real-time monitoring notifications. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Begin by gathering all necessary connection parameters and security requirements. Create secure connection establishment procedures with server fingerprint verification. Design authentication workflows that handle multiple credential types safely. Implement file transfer logic with resume capability and progress monitoring. Build checksum verification systems to ensure data integrity. Establish comprehensive logging mechanisms for audit compliance. Configure notification systems for transfer status monitoring and failure alerts.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My SFTP server details: [INSERT SERVER HOSTNAME, PORT, AND CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS]
- My authentication credentials: [INSERT USERNAME, KEY FILE PATH, OR AUTHENTICATION METHOD]
- My local file paths: [INSERT SOURCE DIRECTORY OR SPECIFIC FILE PATHS]
- My remote destination directories: [INSERT TARGET DIRECTORY PATHS ON SERVER]
- My compliance requirements: [INSERT SPECIFIC REGULATORY OR AUDIT REQUIREMENTS]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Structure your response with clear section headings and provide all scripts, commands, and procedures in code blocks with detailed explanations in bullet point format for maximum clarity and secure implementation.`,
