  prompt: `Adopt the role of a crisis communication specialist and customer recovery expert who has managed high-stakes service failures for major brands, understanding the psychology of apologies, trust restoration, and how to transform negative experiences into loyalty-building moments through exceptional recovery communication. Your primary objective is to create comprehensive apology and service recovery message templates for various service failure scenarios that acknowledge failures honestly, demonstrate genuine accountability, explain what went wrong, outline concrete resolution steps, and rebuild confidence in future service delivery in a structured template format with clear communication phases. Service failures are inevitable, but inconsistent and defensive responses damage customer relationships. Analysis shows customers who experience service failure followed by excellent recovery have 12% higher loyalty scores than customers who never experienced problems, while poor recovery attempts drive churn rates 3x higher than baseline. You need systematic service recovery approaches that turn failures into opportunities demonstrating commitment to customer satisfaction. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Create seven complete service recovery templates covering these scenarios: System Outage (service unavailable for extended period), Data Loss/Security Incident (customer data affected or compromised), Billing Error (incorrect charges or payment processing failures), Quality Failure (product/service didn't perform as promised), Delayed Delivery (significant delay beyond promised timeline), Miscommunication (wrong information provided by team), and Repeated Issues (customer experiencing same problem multiple times). For each scenario, structure your templates using this recovery framework: Immediate Acknowledgment Phase (lead with empathy and ownership without "if you were affected" language, clearly state what went wrong without technical jargon, take full accountability without excuses, provide specific resolution timeline), Resolution Phase (explain what you're doing to fix the immediate problem, outline prevention steps, offer appropriate compensation, provide direct escalation path to human representative), and Rebuilding Phase (demonstrate changes made as direct result of failure, invite feedback on resolution approach, reaffirm commitment to customer relationship, include follow-up plan to ensure satisfaction). Incorporate variables for personalization throughout templates. Include decision tree for compensation amounts based on customer value and failure severity, and suggested timeline for each communication touchpoint.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
My company/service type: [INSERT YOUR COMPANY OR SERVICE TYPE]
My typical service failure scenarios: [INSERT YOUR MOST COMMON SERVICE FAILURE TYPES]
My customer segments: [INSERT YOUR CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND VALUE TIERS]
My compensation options available: [INSERT AVAILABLE COMPENSATION OPTIONS]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Format each of the seven templates as a markdown table with columns: Scenario | Initial Acknowledgment Email (150 words) | Resolution Update (100 words) | Follow-Up Message (100 words) | Compensation Guidelines | Escalation Triggers. After the seven templates, provide a separate decision tree table for compensation amounts and a communication timeline table. Use [CUSTOMER NAME], [FAILURE TYPE], [IMPACT DESCRIPTION], [RESOLUTION TIMELINE], [COMPENSATION OFFERED], [PREVENTION MEASURES], and [ACCOUNT MANAGER NAME] as placeholder variables throughout templates.`,
