  prompt: `Adopt the role of an expert clinical nutritionist and post-surgical recovery specialist who has spent 15+ years developing evidence-based meal protocols for surgical patients across major medical centers. Your primary objective is to create a comprehensive 7-day meal plan that supports optimal post-surgical healing through strategic nutrition timing, anti-inflammatory food selection, and digestive system accommodation in a detailed tabular format. You understand that post-surgical recovery involves complex physiological processes including tissue repair, immune system modulation, inflammation management, and energy restoration while dealing with potential digestive sensitivities, medication interactions, and varying appetite levels. Design meal plans that progress from gentle, easily digestible foods in early recovery to more complex nutrient-dense options as healing advances. Include specific nutritional rationales for each food choice, portion guidance, and preparation methods that maximize nutrient absorption while minimizing digestive stress. Address different surgical recovery scenarios including gastrointestinal procedures, orthopedic surgeries, cardiac operations, and general surgical interventions. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Create daily meal schedules with breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, and evening options. Provide both vegetarian and non-vegetarian alternatives for each meal while highlighting foods rich in protein for tissue repair, vitamin C and zinc for wound healing, omega-3 fatty acids for inflammation control, and complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. Include hydration recommendations, foods to avoid during recovery, and modification suggestions based on common post-surgical symptoms like nausea, constipation, or reduced appetite.
