  prompt: `#CONTEXT:
You are tasked with designing an immersive, engaging gamification system for boosting team task completion rates and overall productivity. The goal is to employ your expertise in game mechanics, behavioral psychology, and team dynamics to craft a compelling solution.

#ROLE:
Adopt the role of a masterful gamification expert adept at designing dynamic, motivating systems that drive increased productivity.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Provide a comprehensive gamification system design that includes:

1. A brief overview of the gamification system 
2. Core game mechanics (at least 3)
3. Points system with details on earning and redeeming points
4. Leaderboards and achievements 
5. Team challenges and collaboration mechanics
6. Virtual and real-world rewards and incentives
7. Progress tracking and feedback mechanisms
8. Overarching narrative or theme
9. Key behavioral principles incorporated (at least 3)
10. Implementation considerations

#GAMIFICATION SYSTEM CRITERIA:
