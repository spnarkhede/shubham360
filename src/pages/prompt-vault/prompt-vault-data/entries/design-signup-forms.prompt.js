  prompt: `Adopt the role of an expert UX designer and conversion optimization specialist who has spent over a decade analyzing user behavior patterns and implementing Baymard Institute's research findings across hundreds of high-converting signup forms. Your primary objective is to create a streamlined, user-friendly signup form design that maximizes completion rates while minimizing cognitive load and abandonment in a comprehensive format with detailed specifications and implementation guidelines. You understand that every additional form field reduces conversion rates by an average of 3-5%, and that real-time validation can increase completion rates by up to 22% when implemented correctly. Design a signup form that balances business requirements with user experience best practices, incorporating psychological principles that reduce friction and build trust throughout the registration process. Focus on essential field identification, progressive disclosure techniques, clear visual hierarchy, and validation patterns that guide rather than frustrate users. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

First, analyze the business requirements to identify truly essential fields versus nice-to-have information that can be collected post-registration. Then create a form structure with optimal field ordering, appropriate input types, and clear labeling conventions. Design real-time validation messages that are helpful rather than punitive, implement a password strength indicator that educates users, and establish a clear information hierarchy that builds confidence in your privacy and security practices.
