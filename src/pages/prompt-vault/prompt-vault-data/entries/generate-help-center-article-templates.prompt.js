  prompt: `Adopt the role of an expert content strategist for customer education with deep expertise in technical writing, UX writing, and self-service knowledge base optimization. Your primary objective is to generate a reusable template system for help center articles that drive actual self-service behavior rather than support ticket escalation, delivered as four distinct article templates with fully realized example articles for each. You understand that most help centers fail not from lack of content but from poor structure, buried answers, and walls of impenetrable text that frustrate users into contacting support. Your templates must enforce radical scannability, front-load answers, use action-oriented language, and guide users to successful outcomes without human intervention. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

#CONTEXT:
The user operates a help center suffering from the classic self-service paradox: articles exist covering common issues, yet users bypass them entirely, creating support tickets for problems already documented. Engagement metrics reveal the brutal truth—low page views, high bounce rates, and ticket volume that directly contradicts article coverage. The content isn't missing; it's structurally broken. Users arrive seeking immediate solutions but encounter feature documentation written like product briefs, step-by-step guides that bury prerequisites, and troubleshooting articles organized by internal taxonomy rather than customer language. Previous content follows no consistent template, forcing each article to reinvent structure while writers default to exhaustive explanation over actionable guidance. The user needs a template system that transforms their help center from a content graveyard into a functional self-service engine.

Create four distinct article templates, each optimized for a specific content type and user intent. For each template, provide the structural framework with explicit formatting rules, then demonstrate that framework through one fully realized example article using the user's product context. Do not use placeholder text like "[Insert content here]"—write complete example articles that serve as working models.

**Template 1 — "How to" Process Article:** Structure this for step-by-step task completion. Include a one-sentence summary at the very top stating the end result (not the topic description), a prerequisites section listed before step 1 so users know what they need before starting, numbered steps beginning with action verbs, expected outcomes after each step allowing users to confirm progress, and a "Didn't work?" callout at the bottom addressing the two most common failure points with their fixes. Target 300-500 words. Enforce these standards: open with the outcome, keep paragraphs to maximum 3 sentences, include at least one internal link to a related article, use formatting for scannability not decoration.

**Template 2 — "Understanding" Concept Article:** Structure this for explaining how something works or what a feature does. Include an opening line stating why the reader should care (the benefit, not the feature list), a plain-language explanation section of no more than 150 words, a "When to use this" section with 2-3 real scenarios showing practical application, and a "Common questions" section with 3 Q&As addressing typical confusion points. Avoid feature-specification language that reads like internal product documentation. Target 400-600 words. Enforce these standards: lead with user benefit, maximum 3 sentences per paragraph, include at least one internal link, prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness.

**Template 3 — "Fix This" Troubleshooting Article:** Structure this for problem resolution. Include the problem statement as the article title written exactly how a frustrated customer would describe it (not engineering terminology or error codes), a "Quick fix" box at the very top with the single most common solution, a diagnostic checklist formatted as "If [symptom], try [solution]" pairs, platform-specific notes where relevant, and a clear escalation path when self-service fails. Target 300-500 words. Enforce these standards: put the most likely solution first, use customer language not internal jargon, keep paragraphs to 3 sentences maximum, include at least one internal link.

**Template 4 — "Getting Started" Quickstart Article:** Structure this for new users completing a specific setup task for the first time. Include a "What you'll need" prerequisites box, realistic estimated completion time, steps grouped into logical phases rather than one overwhelming numbered list, a "You're done—here's what to do next" section linking to the logical next article in their journey, and a "Skip this if..." note at the top for users who may not need this guide. Target 400-700 words. Enforce these standards: set clear expectations upfront, break long processes into phases, maximum 3 sentences per paragraph, include at least one internal link to continue the user journey.

For all four templates, write one complete example article demonstrating the template structure in action using the user's product context. Label each template clearly and separate them for easy reference. Show how the structural rules translate into actual content that users can scan, understand, and act on without contacting support.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
My product/service: [INSERT YOUR PRODUCT OR SERVICE DESCRIPTION]
My help center current state: [INSERT NUMBER OF ARTICLES AND ENGAGEMENT METRICS - e.g., "47 articles, 12% average time on page, 68% bounce rate, high ticket volume on documented topics"]
My primary user pain points: [INSERT THE TOP 3-5 ISSUES USERS CONTACT SUPPORT ABOUT]
My product's key features that need documentation: [INSERT 3-5 CORE FEATURES OR WORKFLOWS]
My target user profile: [INSERT USER TECHNICAL SKILL LEVEL AND CONTEXT - e.g., "small business owners, non-technical, using product during high-stress moments"]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Deliver all four templates with their fully realized example articles clearly labeled and separated. Do not use placeholder text—write complete example articles that demonstrate each template structure in practice so the user can immediately see how the framework functions with real content.`,
  whatItDoes: [
    'Analyzes help center content to create four reusable article templates that improve self-service support.',
    'Generates fully written example articles for each template type using your product details as reference models.',
    'Structures each AI prompt template around user behavior patterns to reduce support tickets and increase article engagement.',
  ],
  tips: [
    'Test each AI prompt template with real customer support tickets to identify which article type solves the most common issues, then prioritize creating content using that template first.',
    'Track which template format drives the lowest bounce rates and highest time-on-page metrics, then adapt your existing underperforming articles to match that winning structure.',
    'Use the AI prompt output as a training tool for your support team, showing them how to write scannable content that reduces ticket volume and improves customer self-service success rates.',
  ],
  howToUse: [
    'Fill in the [DESCRIBE YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE], [NUMBER], and [DESCRIBE ENGAGEMENT] placeholders with details about what you offer, how many help articles you have, and how users interact with them.',
    'Example: "My product is a project management tool for remote teams. My help center has 47 articles that get low page views, high bounce rate, and lots of tickets on topics we already have articles for."',
