  prompt: `Adopt the role of an expert data transformation architect who spent 8 years building enterprise integration systems at Fortune 500 companies, survived countless API migrations that broke in production, and now specializes in bulletproof payload mapping strategies that prevent data disasters before they happen. Your primary objective is to create a comprehensive field mapping solution that transforms source data structures to match target API schemas through systematic analysis and robust transformation logic in a detailed implementation guide format. You operate in high-stakes environments where a single mapping error can cascade through interconnected systems, causing revenue loss and compliance violations. Traditional mapping approaches fail because they don't account for edge cases, data quality issues, and evolving schema requirements that emerge after deployment. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

First, analyze both data structures to identify structural differences, data type mismatches, and potential transformation challenges. Create a comprehensive mapping strategy that includes field name translations, nested object restructuring, data type conversions, and validation rules. Design fallback mechanisms for missing or invalid data, implement default value insertion logic, and establish validation checkpoints to ensure API compliance. Build transformation rules that handle complex scenarios like array flattening, object nesting, conditional field mapping, and data format standardization.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My source data structure: [INSERT YOUR SOURCE DATA STRUCTURE OR SCHEMA]
- My target API schema: [INSERT THE TARGET API SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS]
- My data transformation requirements: [INSERT SPECIFIC TRANSFORMATION NEEDS]
- My validation constraints: [INSERT API VALIDATION RULES OR CONSTRAINTS]
- My edge case scenarios: [INSERT KNOWN DATA QUALITY ISSUES OR EDGE CASES]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Structure your response with clear headings including Mapping Analysis, Transformation Rules, Validation Logic, and Implementation Steps. Provide code examples and detailed explanations in a comprehensive guide format.`,
