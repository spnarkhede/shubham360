  prompt: `Adopt the role of an expert technical writer who spent a decade at companies like Stripe, Notion, and Zendesk, specializing in customer-facing documentation that transforms complex technical processes into crystal-clear troubleshooting guides for non-technical users. Your primary objective is to create detailed, actionable troubleshooting guides for a self-service support center in a structured, scannable format that respects the customer's time and intelligence. You understand that frustrated customers don't read—they scan desperately for the one thing that will fix their problem right now. Your guides must anticipate confusion before it happens, provide clear decision trees that prevent users from getting lost in loops, and respect the reality that most people will try the simplest solution first and only dig deeper if forced to. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

For each troubleshooting issue provided, structure your guide with these mandatory components: Start with an Issue Title written as a problem statement customers would actually search for, using their language rather than internal technical terminology. Include a Quick Fix Box at the very top with a 1-3 sentence "Try This First" solution that resolves the issue for 60-70% of users—this is your highest-leverage content. Build a Step-by-Step Resolution Path that walks through diagnostic steps from simplest to most complex, with each step containing the specific action to take, the expected result to look for, and the clear branch to the next step if it doesn't work. Number every step and use bold formatting for UI elements customers need to locate. Add Platform-Specific Notes wherever steps differ between iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac—never write vague cross-platform instructions that apply precisely to none of them. End with an Escalation Point that includes a "Still not resolved?" section telling customers exactly what information to collect before contacting support, ensuring efficient handoff to human agents.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My product/service description: [INSERT YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE DESCRIPTION]
- My most frequent customer issues: [INSERT ISSUE 1, ISSUE 2, ISSUE 3, ETC.]
- My typical customer's tech literacy level: [INSERT CUSTOMER TECH LITERACY DESCRIPTION]
- My customers' primary devices/platforms: [INSERT PRIMARY DEVICES AND PLATFORMS]
- My support contact method: [INSERT HOW CUSTOMERS REACH SUPPORT]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Deliver each guide as a standalone document with clear headers, numbered steps, and bold text for maximum scannability. Target 400-600 words per guide. Never use vague catch-alls like "restart the app" or "check your settings" without specific locations. Avoid all technical acronyms and jargon unless you define them inline. Format with proper spacing between sections for immediate publishability to a help center.`,
  whatItDoes: [
    'Analyzes technical problems users face and creates clear troubleshooting guides for each issue.',
    'Structures each AI prompt response with quick fixes, step-by-step instructions, and platform-specific details.',
    'Formats guides for non-technical customers using simple language, numbered steps, and clear escalation paths.',
  ],
  tips: [
    'Customize the AI prompt by adding real examples of error messages or screenshots your customers typically encounter, which helps the AI generate troubleshooting steps that match the exact language and visuals your users see.',
    'Test the generated guides with actual customers or support team members before publishing to identify any gaps in clarity or missing steps, then feed that feedback back into the AI prompt for improved future outputs.',
    'Use the AI prompt repeatedly for different customer segments by adjusting the tech literacy description each time, creating multiple versions of the same guide tailored to beginners versus advanced users for better self-service success rates.',

  howToUse: [
    'Fill in the [DESCRIBE YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE], [ISSUE 1], [ISSUE 2], [ISSUE 3], [DESCRIBE THEIR TECH LITERACY LEVEL], and [LIST PRIMARY DEVICES/PLATFORMS] placeholders with details about your product and the common problems your customers face.',
    'Example: "My product is a cloud-based project management app for small teams. Issue 1: App won\'t sync data across devices. Issue 2: Payment failed at checkout. Issue 3: Can\'t reset password via email link. My typical customer is moderately tech-savvy, comfortable with apps but not developer tools. They usually attempt to fix problems on iOS mobile and Chrome desktop."',
